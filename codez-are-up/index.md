This is a quick announcement just to let you know that our codes are now getting synced at [code.gnucitizen.org](http://code.gnucitizen.org), which is basically a file browser interface to the source repositories.

The reason we had to come up with something like this is because most of our projects are dispersed across several Google Code repositories, personal SVNs and many other places. We have started so many ideas in the past that now it is hard to keep track of everything. Also, many people ask us for the source codes of old projects and we simply don't know where to point them to.

Not everything is added yet. I will continue to put stuff in as they come!
