If you haven't heard from [RSnake](http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20070423/xss-book-preview)'s or [JG](http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/)'s blogs yet, the long awaited **XSS Attacks** book will be out very soon and here I have the chance to present you with the way the cover will look like in addition to the TOC and a sample chapter. I hope that you find it useful. We've put a lot of effort into making this book possible. It is a quite good technical read so give it a try.

I would like to thank for the opportunity that has been given to me. It has been great honer to work with Seth Fogie, RSnake, Jeremiah Grossman, Anton Rager and Andrew Williams. We all had ups and downs while putting the book together, due to our busy schedules, but we've made it and I am happy with the final result. It was a collective work at its best. I am looking forward to work on other projects with you guys.

I hope that this book will make more people aware of the current threats that concern Web application security. XSS attacks has been with us for a while, yet not that many people realize their potentials. We push really hard to raise the community and industry awareness through the work we publish in our blogs. However, we all have been working on small pieces of the whole puzzle. This book is the definitive guide for every web **application**/**client side** security enthusiast. It is a collection of some of the best publicly disclosed research around the area on browser and web security.

We could have, however, put a lot more into this book. We could have generate the **ultimate** client-side security bible. Nahhh, we tried to stay more down to earth and provide the reader with a technically rich book that is as complete as the predefined book length allowed it to be.

_Enjoy the read!_
