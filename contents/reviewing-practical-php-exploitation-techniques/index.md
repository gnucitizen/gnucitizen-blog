The OWASP London Chapter last night (03/Apr/08) was excellent. Thanks to everyone involved for a top night!

* For those who didn't attend, **Rodrigo Marcos** discussed his research on hacking PHP sockets for fun and profit. I found the concept very interesting. He discussed hacking PHP sockets; however, the techniques he discusses could be used as an application reverse proxy, although, scalability and stability could be a problem.
* **David Kierznowski (myself)** gave a talk on practical PHP exploitation techniques using real world examples. I think we scared some of the guys from a certain university who recognised real world vulnerable code in their own applications :)
* **Colin Watson** opened a can of worms in his discussion of security badges (Hacker Safe, Hacker proof etc). We had a good discussion on this!

I have uploaded my [presentation](http://www.gnucitizen.org/static/blog/2008/04/php-code-analysis-real-world-examples.pdf) to my site. I spent a lot of time trying to get good screenshots, so I hope it makes it easy to follow for those who couldn't attend.
