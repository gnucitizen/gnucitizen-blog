In the light of the [Month of New Security Buzzwords](http://www.cgisecurity.com/2009/04/month-of-new-security-buzzwords.html), I am releasing an online [fuzzer](http://buzz.gnucitizen.org) to help you generate as many security buzzwords as you like. _Sweet!_

Jokes aside, tools like this one are quite helpful to brainstorm new ideas. If you ever do research inspired by our buzzword generator, please give us a credit. That way we will know that the tool is actually useful.
