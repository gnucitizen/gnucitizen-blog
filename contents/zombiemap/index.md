ZombieMap is an AJAX application that you can use to locate Zombies hooked on a XSS proxy. If you XSS someone and you attach it ZombieMap, their GEO location will magically appear. The project does not have any other merit apart from being fun.

ZombieMap is highly extensible mapping application. Developers can extend virtually every aspect of the application environment. If you cannot see points on the map in the first 5 seconds, most probably there are no attached clients. For testing purposes, open another browser (different from the one you use for ZombieMap) and point it to the channel URL. Have fun!

**UPDATE 2011/04/19: ** This project is pretty much dead now. If you are willing to contribute to the project, please contact us.
