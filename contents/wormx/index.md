WormX is a collection of various notorious web worms mostly written on the top of popular client-side technologies and propagating primarily on social networking web sites.

For those of you who do not know what ajax worms are, here is a bit of Internet history:

> In October 2005, a flaw in the MySpace's site design was exploited by a user only known as "Samy" to create the world's first self-propagating cross-site scripting worm. MSNBC has also reported that MySpace is a "hotbed" for spyware, and that infection rates are rising because of MySpace. In addition to this, the customization of user pages currently allows the injection of certain HTML which can be crafted to form a phishing user profile. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySpace)

If you want to submit a worm, we are going to need the following information:

1. **Worm name** - It must be enclosed inside `<h3>[atom name here]</h3>` tags.
2. **Worm description** - It must start on a new paragraph.
3. **Worm code** - It must be enclosed inside `<pre><code>[atom code here]</code></pre>` tags. If the worm is composed from more then one segments, each one of them must be separated by `<em>[segment name or id]</em>` on a new paragraph.
4. **Worm tags** - It mus be a comma separated string.

_Thanks for the contributions!_
