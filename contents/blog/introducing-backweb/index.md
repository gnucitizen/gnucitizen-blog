After a couple of weeks well spend time in Malaysia and a few days in Singapore, I am quite happy to release the [Backweb Attack Console](http://www.gnucitizen.org/backweb).

The application is in its 0.1a release currently. This means that a lot more work needs to be done. Right now it is quite stable and it should work well with attack channels similar to the one described [here](/blog/persistent-bi-directional-communication-channels). Check the [AttackAPI](/blog/attackapi) project for the attack channel complete source code.

So what is Backweb anyway? The Backweb project is an experiment that was designed to create a full featured attack console for exploiting web browsers, web users and remote applications. Those who are familiar with [XSS Proxy](http://xss-proxy.sourceforge.net/) or even [BEEF](http://www.bindshell.net/tools/beef) might already be familiar with the core principles of the Backweb project.

I tried to make the core as modular as possible although I didn't try vary hard. Those who are curios enough to check the source code will see a few bugs. As a said earlier this is the 0.1a (alpha) release. There is a new release in the SVN trunk that will be ready for download quite soon.

_Documentation is also expected in the next month. If any one is willing to contribute please feel free to [contact me](http://www.gnucitizen.org/contacts). For ideas of how to use this application read this blog._
