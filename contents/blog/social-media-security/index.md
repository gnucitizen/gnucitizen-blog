_I am happy to announce the relaunch of Blogsecurify. I have some more announcements to make._

Blogsecurify will become a division of GNUCITIZEN. Although initially the project was planned to tackle blog-only security issues, today Blogsecurify moves into the more main stream domain - the social media platforms. Therefore, Blogsecurify team will now test and research technologies outside of the blogsphere including things such as wikis, feeds, social networks and all other types of social media technologies.

This is a very exciting for us. We've got a blog, a testing tool and soon a wiki. However, we need smart people like you to join our exclusive team and make it all happen. It is an excellent opportunity if you are interested in investigating security issues in social media technologies. It is also an excellent opportunity to build yourself as an opinion making figure and we promise to use the GNUCITIZEN media platform to promote all of the activities of Blogsecurify tiger team.

So, if you have passion towards web security, you enjoy playing with Web2.0 technologies and you are open for new opportunities, do not hesitate to contact us from our [contact](http://www.gnucitizen.org/contact) page. This opportunity is very unique and extremely exciting. So what do you think?
