    "content": "How about developing an addon in such a way that a \"plausible deniability\" to a gaping security hole is possible? What I mean is - someone can create a not-so-obvious gaping security hole, and still claim innocence, if it can easily be attributed to a coding error, not deliberate action. The thing is, you probably might not be able to pull this more than one or two times.. Then again, some products seem to be literally leaking with remotely exploited security holes - VLC first comes to mind.."

    "content": "As far as I understand, Firefox was not the delivery platform but rather the target of the malware once it had infected the computer by other means.  I don't remember where I read about it.\r\n\r\nThe malware installed a plugin and named it GreaseMonkey.  The malicious plugin looked for and logged details for over 100 finance websites such as banks, Paypal, Amazon and eBay.\r\n\r\nThe rest of your post is, of course, still completely accurate.  The other interesting point this raises is that Firefox has enough marketshare to be worth targeting specifically.  It was inevitable, but it has actually happened now."

    "content": "Nice post pdp. This brings to light something I have thought for a while. What implied trust do you give to a Firefox add-on when you decide to install it?  Quite a bit really.\r\n\r\nOne thought is a community review process an add-on goes through before publishing live.  Code reviewed, product beta tested and then given a stamp of approval. I know they have the experimental add-ons, maybe tie this idea in.  I don't know. Plus it wouldn't do any good if the 'community' was \"in on it\" together. ;-)"

The sad thing is that no one really worried about stuff like full user privileged file system access and friends. You might be interested but really i don't really see much change since pdp's post in the far 2008. I think as long as FF will consider 3rd party add-ons as \"integral part of itself\" we will always have to watch our backs!"
