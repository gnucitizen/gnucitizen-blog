Although London enjoys one of the most vibrant infosec industries in the world, there are not as many hacker and security events and one would think. Meetings-wise, we have organizations such as [2600](http://www.london2600.org.uk/), [Defcon](http://dc4420.org/), and [Owasp](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London) among others. However, the number of attendees needs to be improved. Usually, having a turnup of 20 people on one of these meetings is considered a success in London. Not much for such a big city if you think about it.

I've talked to a few people at some of these meetings regarding the reason why the sec scene is not that active in London. Most people agree: London has a very good infosec market where security professionals get paid very good salaries. Therefore, people don't find the need to participate in security-related activities outside work. Whatever the reason is, I can tell you this: when you like something too much, and there is not enough people to share the love for your passion, you do whatever it takes to meet other people with the same interest.

> Either way I encourage you to attend these meetings if you are based in London. Last Tuesday, I presented "Cracking into embedded devices and beyond!". I recommend you to check it out if you are interested in embedded devices security. R. Marcos also gave a presentation titled "Blind SQL Injection: Optimization Techniques" which I found highly interesting although I'm not sure if the slides have been published yet.
