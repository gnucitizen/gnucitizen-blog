Data URLs are not able to access cookies and other information mainly because they are loaded in completely new page, not to mention that they exist in the about:blank space.\n\nThe impact of Self-contained XSS Attacks varies depending on how skillful the attacker is. There are many possible attack scenarios.\n\nJason, I am happy that you like the blog. I hope that it continues to be this way in the feature. Thanks."

Apparently you are.\r\n\r\nTo be honest with you, cookie theft is probably one of least things I am interested in. Data URLs are brilliant for enabling very powerful attacks. I am surprised that they have been covered so vaguely in past. There is so much potential in them.\r\n\r\nI am quite concerned about JavaScript tools being able to assemble PDF and DOC documents on the fly. What about worms that carry their payloads in a single URL? IMHO this is a serious security issue."
