    "content": "djteller, :) yeh right. first of all you have to educate the administrators. What I am trying to show here is how easy it is sometimes to gain remote access without too much effort. The security community and industry in general is sooo much into vulnerability research that they forget to look at the most obvious, the most simplistic, and the most successful threats. Who needs 0days when Andrea Johnson, the secretary from 3rd floor, will unawarely let you in?\r\n\r\nMoreover, most people have never heard of Windows Terminal services. The don't know how they even look like. So, what's going to happen if the attacker just spawns a full-screen session on their desktop? They will probably think that somehow they logged out; type their username and password, and of course let the attacker in. Simple and effective."

In a corporation this is likely to be a gateway I guess and not a big secret.\r\n\r\nI also noticed the \"working directory:s:C:\\\". Some of us don't have download and execute rights in our root directories. Is there a more elegant approach to this? Is %TEMP% supported here?"

I'm not sure about you, but with the rest of the security industry, it is pretty accepted that there is no silver bullet.\r\n\r\nWe need and will always need layered defense in order to protect data and systems when one layer is thwarted.\r\n\r\nYou might say that people will always be a weak link, and that could be true even in an environment with security in depth. In fact, security in depth is even more needed due to the human factor. If people can make stupid mistakes, put up roadblocks, nets, and pointy objects in their way so they don't stupidly make those mistakes...\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have a different definition of \"security in depth,\" in which case I beg that you explain it so that everyone can move beyond focusing on that statement. Maybe we're really on the same page and just have different meanings to this rather common security term..."
