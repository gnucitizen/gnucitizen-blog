If the majority of people still don't get it, then they better go and read anywhere else. You guys have been through an excelent research and disclosure work, and I really thank you for that. I, as you do, think that this issue is highly critical. Reminds me the times when the majority of snmp devices came with \"public\" and \"private\" as the default keys. \n\nIt will take a long until this scenario changes. Normal people, not security professionals or just computer related professionals, doesn't concern about this kind of topics, so we will have to wait until the need of new devices cames out, which will came with UPnP not activated by default or with authentication added to the protocol, and the eariler that this is going to  happen is with the next network technology jump, maybe fiber at home. Not too soon, definitlely."

UPnP!\r\n\r\nMany of you say that it is ok to turn UPnP off. Well, I am not sure about that. As a security guy I recommend turning UPnP off. Though, I can clearly see how this can turn into a problem. People does use it. Go explain to our grandma how to add a portforward through the admin interface so that she is secure when using whatever program she might have in mind. She would rather leave that decision to the computer, I guess. So let's not be ignorant."

I turned it on and, due to a bug in the Linksy firmware, I found myself locked out of the router interface after I did that. \r\n\r\nEvidently the password is now a random one and the only way to get into the router's interface now is to do a factory reset. That I have been reluctant to do because I use beta firmware (required for one of my most important applications) and would have to go search for that firmware again (it was never on the Linksy FTP server and Linksy will not email it because my router is more than one year old so there is no support). So, I have not fixed the problem. I didn't like FolderShare and haven't needed UPnP on for anything else since I got the router in 2003 so I would simply put the setting for UPnP back to off except I can't get in to do that. \r\n\r\nWhat are all the Microsoft FolderShare folks supposed to do now?"

There must be millions of these boxes in circulation, so I think the \"99% of routers at risk\" statistic is perhaps a bit high. \r\n\r\nOf course, I don't trust little black boxes; I have an IPtables firewall on a Linux box and use dnsmasq on another Linux box for caching DNS - my router is just shifting packets back and forth. Trusting your network security to a closed-source device seems short-sighted to me."

    "content": "To me, this attack still seems more of an interesting curiosity than something to be worried about. \r\n\r\nI can see that the Flash UPnP attack works as described, but I can't see how an attacker could leverage it to take over my PC. \r\n\r\nThe scenario where an attacker changes your DNS server is touted as the worst - it lets him force you into visiting his site (e.g. for browser exploit) via the bad DNS. But he must have *already* been able to dupe you into visiting his site in order to view the SWF in the first place! \r\n\r\nAs for adding port forwarding rules - big deal. I can see how it would make me vulnerable e.g. if I was running a file server or something. But most home users (i.e. Windows) won't be running such services themselves, and the out-of-the-box system services (e.g. port 445) will be protected by the host's own firewall (ICF and maybe others).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to be corrected, as always!"

    "content": "wintermute, if someone changes your DNS they will be able to do a lot more then just forcing to visit a site. They will be able to push down malicious extensions or perform easily the Skype vulnerability that we talked at GNUCITIZEN not that long time ago.\n\nAlso, port forwarding can be quite bad as well. In some cases you can port forward the router's own Web interface in which case you are making it public for attackers. Combine that with the fact that some models allow you to reset the admin credentials through UPnP, then you have a real issue. Opening port forwards to your own machine is interesting but as you said might not be valuable.\n\nExposing your router on the Internet is a big security problem. Changing DNS is also a huge security problem."

    "content": "@Frankum:\r\nUPnP doesn't do any special port-forwarding that you can't do manually (excluding UI limitations in the client or router).  If you have 5 copies of MSN working with UPnP, then UPnP is having the copy at x.x.x.1 use port 10001, x.x.x.2 use port 10002, x.x.x.3 use port 10003, etc.\r\n\r\nAs long as you can set the router to forward port 10001 to x.x.x.1 and can set the client to listen on port 10001, then it will work just fine when you configure it manually.  You just have to make the router and client match.  Depending on the application though, it may or may not be easy/possible to configure which port it listens on.  I have yet to hear of a router that supports UPnP port-forwarding and not manual port-forwarding (though I'm sure some cheapo model out there touts that as a feature).  Also, the number of ports the app uses will directly relate to the annoying factor - it's not a big deal to forward 1 port for 5 clients, but when each copy wants to use 20 ports it will get really annoying."

If nothing else, you immediately become the suspect in a high level investigation that BEGINS with confiscation of all of your equipment that could have been hooked up to that system(computers, servers, digital cameras...)\r\n\r\n  I just read of one open source developer who works off his laptop, snagged a discarded laptop from the trash, then when rebuilding that drive while connected to his working laptop he found it contained child porn.  His working laptop (not just the drive) was confiscated by the police so forensics could find out if the files had originated from HIS computer, even though he was the one who turn in the complaint...  he was unable to maintain his open-source software for several MONTHS until he could get re-imbursed for his system and get another one.\r\n\r\n   Leaving the router open to flash-uPnP attack is sort of like leaving your keys in your car, with it running, while you go into the bank, which just happens to be held up and then they snag your car for the getaway, running someone over on their way out...  now prove you were not part of that robbery and murder."

They allow immediate execution of third party unauthorized software and doesn't restrict what they can do, therefore Flash can't be trusted. No web content should be allowed to originate cross-site traffic or originate LAN traffic. I also think, web browsers should disable links to LAN from WAN. That is, a page at 200.10.10.10 shouldn't be able to create a link to 127.0.0.1, or at least the user should be warned about it.\r\n\r\n2nd: Cheap routers are a huge danger. This is just an example. Many exploits have turned up over the years, and it'll only get worse. \r\n\r\nBut, anyway, most people use Windows so this isn't their biggest threat. And most people that doesn't run windows don't use cheap routers and run them with off the box configurations, so, as always, the assholes that shouldn't be using the net get it, so we shouldn't give a fuck."
