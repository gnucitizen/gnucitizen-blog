[CONFidence](http://2008.confidence.org.pl) was great! We would like to thank to Andrzej, Anna and everybody else in the CONFidence team for making this event one of the greatest experiences of a lifetime. Thanks again. We are looking forward for the next one. :)

There were many interesting presentations. We've tried to attend all of them although it was really hard to do so when the weather in Krakow was so nice (very different from the weather in cloudy/rainy London). As usual, Adrian and I presented our "Cracking into Embedded Devices" and "Client-side Security" talks. However, Adrian had some human vulnerabilities in his slides. All of them were zero-days. I suggest to check them out. I had no human vulnerabilities but I showed the video of the QuickTime exploit for Vista and XP so I guess we are even technically-wise, although I prefer the human exploits to be honest.

Anyway, the client-side security slides can be downloaded from [here](/files/2008/05/client-side-security-slides-confidence2008.pdf). The embedded devices cracking slides can be downloaded from [here](/files/2008/05/cracking-into-embedded-devices-confidence-2k8.pdf). And of course, if you want to see some of the pictures from the event, you can visit [House of Hackers](http://www.houseofhackers.org) and check the [CONFidence 2008 album](http://www.houseofhackers.org/photo/album/show?id=2092781:Album:36981). I am sure that everybody enjoyed the event as much as we did.
