    "content": "I'd like to repeat that although this attack is new, it's based on vulnerabilities we reported to BT several months ago (auth bypass and CSRF especifically). Such vulnerabilities should have been fixed by now. Instead, it appears that BT simply disabled remote assistance on the Home Hub after our first research was published back in October: http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/bt-home-flub-pwnin-the-bt-home-hub\r\n\r\n<div class=\"message\">Therefore, there is nothing new to report to BT at this point. If BT had fixed all the Home Hub vulnerabilities we reported in the past, this call jacking attack would NOT be possible.</div>\r\n\r\nTherefore I consider BT's statement on <a href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/012108-group-points-to-voip-flaw.html?page=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/012108-group-points-to-voip-flaw.html?page=2</a>: <q>Pastor's public disclosure of the flaw on the blog is highly irresponsible</q> very <strong>inappropriate</strong>."

We tested it on 6.2.6.B, which was the most udpated firmware we could get at time of testing without being part of FON. I believe that signing up for FON makes your Home Hub upgrade to a newer firmware? Correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nas pdp pointed out, firmware version 6.2.6.E can take several weeks to upgrade and it appears that many users are having problems receiving the new firmware."
