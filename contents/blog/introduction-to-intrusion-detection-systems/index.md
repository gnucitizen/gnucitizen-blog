"Introduction to Intrusion Detection Systems" is a [presentation](/files/2006/06/introduction-to-intrusion-detection-systems.swf) I did with Rabia Barakat long time ago. There is a paper as well that will be available online as soon as I find it. Although, the depth of the research is not obvious from this presentation, a lot of effort had been put into this work.

**NOTE** Keep in mind that some of the topics covered in this presentation might be a little bit outdated.
