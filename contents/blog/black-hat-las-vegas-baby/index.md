So, Black Hat is next week. Great! I will be happy to see you all there. You may even join me on the 6th at 13:45 - the "Client-side Security" talk. The details of my talk are [here](http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-usa-08/bh-usa-08-speakers.html#Petkov), which btw is the improved version of what I have over [here](/blog/black-hat-europe-2008/).

I am still working on my slides, trying to add that edge-ness I am always striving to achieve combined with a severe doze of simplicity. Don't you know? Simple is the new black.

This time around I am visiting the conference as a tourist. So, I will concentrate more on socializing with all of you nerds, instead of concentrating that much on my talk and business matters. So, see you there.
