It can produce IPs for 1 or a set of countries in ascending or random order, producing unique IPs with low overhead :)\r\n\r\nIt has proved useful when penetration testing to reverse resolve an entire country in order to discover networks or IPs the client forgets to mention.\r\n\r\nIt's available here, http://www.morningstarsecurity.com/research/geoipgen"
