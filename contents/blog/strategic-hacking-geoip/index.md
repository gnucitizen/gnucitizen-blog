Not that long time ago, ap and I did a good play around with GEOIP: ip to country, country to ip mappings, geo locating the IP addresses from the Holy See, etc (yep we've done that). Nothing major, really! We find this topic quite interesting and largely educational, especially around the methodologies and tricks that we have developed in order to find the IP ranges/blocks of entire countries.

Although we've build a quite solid database over the time, we are planning to keep it private and use it for research purposes only. However, if you dig deep into some of our public research [materials](/files/2007/10/country2ip.ppt), you should be able to to create a tiny subset of our database by using some of the described techniques and also [this bash script](/files/2007/10/create-db.sh).

_You can also download a [database digest](/files/2007/10/digest-2007-10-12.zip) created with the bash script above._
