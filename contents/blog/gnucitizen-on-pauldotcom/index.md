We were honored to be guests to Paul and Larry on [PaulDotCom](http://pauldotcom.com/) Security Weekly - the best security podcast on the Web. The show was rather long, about 2 hours, but we've discussed many interesting things. Please mind the quality on Adrian's and especially mine side of the audio stream. I used a very crappy headset, which was the cause of all sorts of problems.

You can access the direct audio stream from the following places:

* **PaulDotCom Security Weekly** - Special Edition - [Interview with GNUCITIZEN Part I](http://media.libsyn.com/media/pauldotcom/pauldotcom-SW-GNUCITIZENpart1.mp3) - March 7th, 2008
* **PaulDotCom Security Weekly** - Special Edition - [Interview with GNUCITIZEN Part II](http://media.libsyn.com/media/pauldotcom/pauldotcom-SW-GNUCITIZENpart2.mp3) - March 7th, 2008

However, if you are an information security junkie, then you should [subscribe to PaulDotCom's audio feed](http://pauldotcom.com/podcast/psw.xml) so you are up-to-date when new shows come out. Alternatively, you can visit [securl.com](http://www.securls.com) where you can find a syndication engine that will keep you updated with everything that is related to security and hacking, including PaulDotCom Security Weekly podcast.

_We also expect Larry and Paul to be guest bloggers at GNUCITIZEN and show us some cool embedded devices hacking stuff._
