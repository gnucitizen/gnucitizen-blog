    "content": "Do you alter your thoughts on this dependant on the company/organisation/domain in question?\r\n\r\nI recently strongly hinted to a well known organisation about a flaw they had with one of their pages; I didn't receive so much as a thank you in reply - however the flaw was patched in less that 3 hours, which was quite impressive.\r\n\r\nThe company employs people for this very reason and probably pays them a pretty decent wage....I now take the stance [for this company] that if the folks they are paying can not secure their own set-up and if they are no going to at least appear grateful when someone tells them for fee, then I won't inform them about anything I may discover on their domain in the future - I won't inform anyone else but I certainly won't inform them."
