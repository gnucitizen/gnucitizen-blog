    "content": "yep, the presentation was mostly taken from very high angle. As far as the Cross-origin Scripting thing, I believe that this is the correct way to explain cross-site scripting and cross-zone scripting bugs, as we are not scripting SITES but different ORIGINS... therefore, Cross-origin scripting. It is much easier to use this one to describe things without too much repetition."
