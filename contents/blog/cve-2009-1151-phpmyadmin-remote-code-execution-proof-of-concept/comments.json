It could be a good idea to add the vuln affecting the 3.1.3.1 version: http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2009-4.php\n\nIt's the same concept but change some files and functions (the setup page is /setup/config.php now, for example). The vulnerable package to play with: http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=23067&filename=phpMyAdmin-3.1.3.1-all-languages.tar.gz\n\nCheers!"
