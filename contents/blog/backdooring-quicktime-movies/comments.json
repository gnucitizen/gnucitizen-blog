We know about them since the 80s. Still, people find clever ways to inject instructions into remote and local processes.\n\nI am sure that HREF tracks is nothing new to core QuickTime/Apple developers. However, the problem is that they wasn't able to spot this potential misuse of their technology. It is not their fault. At the time when this technology was designed, I don't think that anyone was familiar with XSS to that extend as we are today. This problem is so common and I am sure we will see more of it very soon."

If you happen to be on Window, go to MySpace an try to open .mov file that someone has hosted. Then you will receive the update.
