My understanding is that a second volume is completely new material, where a second edition is simply the old material corrected and/or brought up to date.\r\n\r\nIf second volume, one would typically own both volumes 1 &amp; 2.  If second edition, one could simply purchase the second edition and be set.\r\n\r\nWhich is it?  I'll be buying the newer book regardless..."
