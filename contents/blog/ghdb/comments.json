    "content": "I think this example really highlights the dangers you have spent the last god-knows-how-many posts talking about - Same Origin Policy violations are so easy with JSON services developing before browsers have even had a chance to implement JSONRequest or similar. Not that that will necessarily fix anything - offsite script linking isn't going to disappear - I guess we should all just agree - you are right and the way the web is heading this will only get worse."

    "content": "The curse of Web Services. Having to expose your network to anothers in order to obtain the service. Not knowing their standards for security, and how well they maintain them. Right now, we restrict WS to very few enclaves. Even then, every packet route is restricted restricted in its routing from subnet to subnet. \r\n\r\nWhich is good current, yet it undermines the true vision of webservices. IN which you can find anything you need, anytime you want. Getting and sending information to profit both ends. A big headache.\r\n\r\nThanks for keeping it visible! We need all the help we can get."
