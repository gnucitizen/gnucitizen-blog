    "content": "I agree. The further we go the more we are going to see stuff along these lines. Usually, there is no profit from attacking the user directly. I mean, what's the worse thing that can happen? Maybe steal their account and probably find some sensitive information. Although, sure, this is not a good thing, it usually involves a lot of effort mainly because the attacker needs to look for this information and then find a way to use it. Unless the attacker is really dedicated they wont do it. They need a framework. Ad programs have already this framework. All attackers need to do is start using it and eventually abusing it. Ad-Jacking is definitely here to come."
