Since all these error messages are the same, it should've put your site in the supplementals. \r\n\r\nAs you kept your rankings, that must mean google was using the cached version of your pages.\r\n\r\nStill it is kind of weird, maybe google was using a mix of your cached keywords and the new error message.\r\n\r\nIf you are right about all this - it would be pretty easy for spammers to steal keywords and make huge profits."

I appreciate it.\n\nAlthough, SEO is considered a taboo topic in some security circles, I can clearly see its importance to web application security. I am particularly interested in shaping web traffic in terms of fiddling with RSS feeds, spawning related blogs, etc.\n\nIMHO, If attackers know how to use and abuse search engines, the damage they can cause is greater then what we can imagine. I am most definitely interested in continuing this topic."

    "content": "Why is SEO a taboo in some security circles? Is it just because they're opposed to marketing in general?\r\n\r\nBTW, I agree with Jason that there's nothing wrong with the search results you showed. The ordinary behavior for any search is that Google will show, at most, two search results from any one website. If people want to see more results from a particular, that's why they have the \"More results...\" link.\r\n\r\nHowever, his other comments are more a sales pitch than anything else, because his fear-mongering about \"poisoning\" Google search results is just nonsense. Get in touch with him, indeed. I would also challenge the assertion that there is any significant connection between security and SEO. (I would love to have more of a discussion of this, re: your mention of web app security) SEO is marketing, plain and simple, and any attempt to make it seem more technical or geeky or mysterious is just self-aggrandizement. Beyond a basic knowledge of how the internet works, how websites are built, etc (which I would be embarrassed to say was technical to someone who, say, actually writes code), it's just a marketing exercise."
