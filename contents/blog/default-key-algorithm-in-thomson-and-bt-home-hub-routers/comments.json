I mean how hard can it be for them?"

WEPtool takes a Club-Internet.box SSID and generate the corresponding WEP key (yes, our #@! government vote for fascit laws against the citizens while ISP help wardrivers and outlaws). What is really fun is that we did not need to perform any sort of reverse engineering to understand the generation process : the WEPtool relies entirely upon a DDL called FSHash (for File String Hash), and the source code of that library is open source !\r\n\r\nWhat you need is a SHA-1 computing program, and you can hack into any of these.\r\n\r\nThe WEPtool binary and the source code of the FSHash DLL can be found on my humble website). A reverse engineering work has been made by a member of the FRET group, and all of this was originally published in the 2600 Lille meeting reports along the year 2007 and in this thread, thanks to my friend oxyde."

If so the reason that my router's default key isn't in your database is that stkeys inly defaults to keys for units produced in '05 &amp; '06 - my unit is produced (from serial no.) in '07. So to cover v1.5 units (if my guess that this is the problem proves correct) you need to increase the upper limit in stkeys and thus enlarge the database.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the good work!"

    "content": "@noob: 40 bits WEP encryption is usually advertised as 64 bits. They're both the same encryption type and strength.\n\n@jimjamsunny: the tools allow you to find the default WEP/WPA key of the BT Home Hub and Thomson Speedtouch routers.\n\n@Stephen: To answer all your questions: you're probably right the the BT Home Hub v1.5 ALSO follows the same algorithm, but we probably misreported that the attack doesn't work on v1.5. This is because the rainbow tables (BTHH-keys.csv) were created using the default stkeys.exe tool which only generates keys for routers manufactured in the year 2005 and 2006. When attacking the BTHH v1.5, just change the following line in the source code from:\n\n<pre><code>for(year = 5;year &lt;= 6;year++) {</code></pre>\n\nto:\n\n<pre><code>for(year = 5;year &lt;= 8;year++) {</code></pre>\n\nand recompile.\n\nI'd be a good idea to regenerate BTHH-keys.csv adding 2007 and 2008 for attacking the BTHH v1.5. However, the number of possible keys would be increased from 80 to 160 approximately I believe.\n\nstkeys.exe (live generation of keys): http://weiss.u40.hosting.digiweb.ie/stech/stkeys.zip\n\nBTHH-keys.csv (pre-generated keys): http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2008dubai/materials/D2T1%20-%20Adrian%20Pastor%20-%20Cracking%20Into%20Embeded%20Devices%20and%20Beyond.zip"

Not a 3rd party program.\r\n\r\nThis relys on \"zwlancfg.exe\" to automate WZC, if it doesn't work, then neither will this script.\r\n\r\nBefore you run the script, you must first disconnect any and all wireless networks. \"Automatic\" networks, must be set to \"Manual\".\r\n\r\nThe script works by adding a new Automatic wireless profile to WZC, at which point Windows should automatically try to connect, if automatic connections are off, then this script will fail.\r\n\r\nWhen the script displays \"Alive\", it means it has added the profile to WZC, and is waiting for a wireless connection to be established (it does this by checking signal strength). Open WZC and look at the target network, what is it's status?\r\n\r\nOnce a connection has been established, a normal Windows install will attempt to get an IP through DHCP, again, this must be enabled for this to work.\r\n\r\nMy script will wait 3 seconds (ample time for DHCP to respond on my machine), and then attempt to ping Google, it that fails, it'll disconnect and move onto the next key.\r\n\r\n0days of old often contained deliberate mistakes to deter script kiddies. If you don't understand what's going on here, then try and learn rather than hoping somebody will come up with instructions you can blindly follow.\r\n\r\nIf you're not capable of understanding what the script is doing, and where it may go wrong, then you don't deserve free internet. Do what most of us did and work it out for yourselves, it's not that hard."

I eventually put it down to a Picnic problem on my part (Problem in chair not in computer P.I.C.N.I.C). However the script just wouldnt work. I tried running this script against various networks and hubs and got nothing. after Eddy provided me with even more script edits and had me run various checks on my system, Eddy was ready to admit defeat!!!! yes thats right poor Eddy was P***ed right off and spitting feathers.\r\n\r\nnow i was playing around at like 11.30pm or so maybe midnight and fuck me it was working.\r\n\r\nnow then the network i was connected to was an unsecured network that had a better signal than the hub. for some unknown reason this network was disallowing the script to run properly. although, the prefered network list had been cleared it caused the script to crash and just hang. the cause of this was the checkbox along side \"Automaticly Connect To Non Prefered Networks\" within WZC. \r\n\r\nPeople DO NOT check this box. \r\n\r\ni had this set up from a while ago when i was an installer for sky (travelled a lot you see needed a conection) and i diddnt know anything about \"offensive security\". this was causing my wireless to automaticly connect to the network with the best signal. so as the script tried to connect, so did the non preferred network thingy. thus causing them to cancel each other out. i unticked it and bang there it was. a working script.   \r\n\r\nman was i pleased. and Eddy welllll.. Eddy was no longer spitting feathers, he stuck them in his cap and danced round the camp fire, half naked, till it rained. (Not literally lol)\r\n\r\nany way i got a good nights sleep without waking up thinking about getting the script to work and Eddy received my confirmation of a working script pre-coffee so hopefully it give him a good start to the day.\r\n\r\nsee look another happy ending.\r\n\r\nI hope this might be some help to someone out there."

    "content": "Ok chaps this will be my last post on this particular topic.\r\n\r\nThe problems a lot of you seem to be having are to do with how the script checks weather it is connected or not, I will try and explain in brief how this works.\r\n\r\nYou can query the WMI to retrieve the signal strength of a Wireless connection*, if nothing is connected, it'll throw an error**.\r\n\r\nFirst the script attempts to connect, it adds the WZC profile, and then repeatedly queries the WMI , waiting until it detects a signal strength, at which point, it will display \"Alive!\" and the DHCP timeout will begin. It is after this the problem is occurring.\r\n\r\nIf the DHCP timeout is reached and the script is unable to ping www.google.com*** it then removes the WZC profile, and now beings to query the WMI again, THIS TIME waiting for NO signal to be returned, when this happens, it displays \"Dead\" and will move to the next key.\r\n\r\nThe issue i've seen most commonly with this, are Virtual Adaptors and things of that nature WILL SOMETIMES LOG A SIGNAL STRENGTH, thus causing the script to never to reach the \"Dead\" point, which in turn means the script will not progress.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, you must make sure that there's NOTHING apart from your wireless adaptor producing a signal strengh, or alternativly find a more effecient method of checking the wireless status. This can be done VERY easily in Vista using the netsh command.\r\n\r\nThis is the last time I will say it, unless you have at least a rudimentay understanding of HOW the script works, you wont have a HOPE at getting it working if not already. So it pays to read.\r\n\r\n*This is why I say DISCONNECT all other wireless adaptors before using the script\r\n**Hence the mess of \"on error\" statements\r\n***If you access the internet through a proxy, or have some other quirk in the setup, it will ALWAYS fail, and never find the key."

This does present a minor problem, as who wants to manually try those.  But we have already seen some homebaked tools that will get around that for you.\r\n\r\nEdward Pearson mentioned a VB script he wrote that will prove the theory on windows - i don't see this anywhere now.  I wrote a very easy to use solution yesterday that does everything for the HomeHubs - you just run:\r\n\r\ncscript scriptname.vbs A123 &gt; A123.log\r\n\r\n... and youll get the correct key back within half an hour.  I have given each key plenty of time to be tried, so its not a lightning quick attack.  Its very verbose and user friendly - if anyone would like a look let me know.\r\n\r\nI might upload and post a link after ive tidied it up a bit (though it is a relatively tiny script!!!).\r\n\r\n\r\nGood topic folks."

Just download the \"Cracking Into Embeded Devices and Beyond\" presentation ZIP file: http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2008dubai/materials/\r\n\r\nHowever, I want to be clear that this is NOT a skiddie-friendly tool, as it can be unreliable due to its dependency on good signal strength of the target BTHH. On top of that it only works on Linux as it's based on the iwconfig tool. \r\n\r\nAlso remember that the attack only works against BTHHs v1.0 and v1.5, as v2.0 uses a different algorithm for the default wifi encryption keys.\r\n\r\nThere are much more clever ways to perform this attack than how I implemented it in this tool. But as I said, this tool wasn't written so that kids go around breaking into their neighbors' BTHHs, but rather as a proof of concept that it's possible (thanks to Kevin Devine's RE work ultimately).\r\n\r\nThere are guys who successfully ported the tool to work on Windows systems (see comments on this page for more info).

I'm assuming the CC value in the example is EH and the PP value is M but that can't be right as M isn't a hex value so how was the XXX value calculated.I just don't know what the PP values are and if my assumption is correct.I can't find info online explaining this is or am I just being blonde in my searching.\n2. Using Network Stumbler I have a netgear router-secured with wpa and from what I've read you can obtain the serial number from the mac address.Is this still the case as the example i've tried only generates a 7decimal figure. From there I've used an online sha1 hash tool that gave me a hash code based on what i presume to be the serial number.  From this and your example I used the 1st 10 hexdigits to generate a code but this didn't work.\n\nSo what I'm doing is trying to understand how to obtain a serial from a mac address, what the CC &amp; PP values are and do these values reflect all network devices regardless of manufacturer.is it still possible to get hold of the stkeys as the links don't work anymore.\n\nAnyway hope I'm not being too thick but I would like to understand the process more.The last time I used hex was back in secondary school :)"
