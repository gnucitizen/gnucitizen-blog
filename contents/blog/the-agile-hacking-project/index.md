This is a quick announcement regarding the Agile Hacking project. For those of you who are not familiar with this project, there is a post that you can go through over [here](/blog/agile-hacking).

So, the Agile Hacking project has found a new home in the newly established [House of Hackers V2](http://v2.houseofhackers.org) initiative, which is essentially the [House of Hackers](http://www.houseofhackers.org)' wiki. We plan to use V2 as our main project repository. We might even move the GNUCITIZEN lab into V2 as it will allow us to feed even greater value back to the community. I will write another post on this topic soon.

So, I know that some of you are already very passionate about the Agile Hacking project and I am hoping that we can join forces in the next couple of months in order to make it all happen. There are already a bunch of contributions which I will start importing into the wiki but if you can help me with this heavy task, it will be even better. Again, "Agile Hacking" is a community driven project and it will succeed only if the community believes in it.

If you cannot contribute but you like the idea behind the project or you believe in the overall goal, than you can support us by promoting the initiative on your blogs and social profiles.
