    "content": "Hi Morgon. There is no reason for calling it V2. It just came to me and I though that this is a good code name. I have already informed the HoH community that I am looking for better names and I am open to suggestions. In fact, I am really hoping that the community will come up with the name as this is yet another community project.\n\nAs for HoH, yes there are some people that do not belong there but we will either try to make them behave or essentially ban them from the network. But it is an open network so everybody have the right to express themselves as long as a few ethical principles are followed."

Yeah they are their, yeah they are in the minority, and hopefully they will learn, and contribute, or leave. Yeah it is tough coming up with names sometimes, I was just thinking v2 leant itself more to being a new version, a replacement."
