Opera is not affected. Here is a demonstration of his code:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>&lt;form method=\"post\" action=\"http://kuza55.awardspace.com/files.php\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"&gt;\r\n&lt;textarea name='file\"; filename=\"filename.ext\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; '&gt;Arbitrary File\r\nContents&lt;/textarea&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=\"submit\" value='Send \"File\"' /&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\r\n\r\nhmmm, very, very, interesting."

I've only played with the AS2 LoadVars Class (Since I've been to lazy to setup Flex, etc), so I thought you couldn't use Flash to do that since LoadVars URL encodes whatever you put in request body.\r\n\r\nAre there many differences between the LoadVars and URLRequest classes?"

    "content": "<code>LoadVars</code> is inferior when compared to <code>URLRequest</code> combined with <code>navigateToURL</code> or even better <code>sendToURL</code>. Simply put, the <code>navigateToURL</code> function will open the result into a browser window/tab while <code>sendToURL</code> will silently execute it in the background. No restrictions applied!\r\n\r\nbtw, setting up flex environment is not very hard. you just need the FlexSDK .zip file. Decompress it somewhere on the disk. write your MXML or AS and compile with mxmlc like this:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>path/to/flexsdk/<strong>bin/mxmlc path/to/app.mxml</strong></code></pre>"

Especially if you used sendToURL().\r\n\r\nIf I understand what is presented on the above referenced page, and I may not, then if you could get anyone to visit your page you could upload any file you wished to your server from their local machine.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? Am I crazy?"
