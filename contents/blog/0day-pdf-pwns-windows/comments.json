This is with Active X totally turned off in 4 IE zones but probably still on in the 5th zone which I have not made visible. (Note, i do not use browser plugins and do not have Adobe installed, so it was clearly the Active X.)\r\n\r\npdp, will you at least say whether what you've found is the same as or different than the greymagic POC?

Successful exploitation of the PDF issue relays on a few other things.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has no other choice but to patch up the issue just to satisfy the community, even though this may not by entirely their problem. First of all developers should not really trust the user input and pass it to a function that they don't fully understand. Now, some of you may criticize me for this statement, but do we blame PHP or ASP for the SQL Injections that your software has? No! Why should anyone pass something that does not look like a URL into a function that expects URLs?"

With the PDF vulnerability, it is still contained.\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of full disclosure *if the vendor is unresponsive* as a means to increase pressure for a solution. If I can find a vulnearbility, so can many others, so we need a fix. But if the vendor has acknowledged and is working towards a 'cure', give them time before unleashing the madness."
