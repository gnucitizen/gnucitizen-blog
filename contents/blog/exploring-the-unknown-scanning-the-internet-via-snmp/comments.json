Our goal was to sample publicly available SNMP device as we find that people ignore SNMP, don't ask, don't know why. Given the fact that most embedded devices we have encountered so far, have some seriously screwed up SNMP implementations, we find this research very interesting. Therefore, we wanted to share it with the rest of the security community as it may come handy. That's all!"

Is that right?\n2.) in the snmp (read/write) test my router is  not vulnerable (according to your document). What is the reason? snmp disabled or what?\n4.)

Once you discover a ZyXEL router with SNMP reachable from the Internet you'll find out that many adjacent ZyXEL routers that belong to the same netblock suffer the same problem!\n2) Please specify the section/page of the paper. Most likely it means that SNMP is *not* enabled with read and write access by default.\n3) It *is* if SNMP is enabled and configured to be visible from the WAN interface (you can check this via the web and telnet interface)\n4) We recommend you to disable SNMP which is explained in your router's manual (you should be able to do it via Telnet)."
