    "content": "I joined Myspace just over a week ago now and I got a message saying that it was found that my system had QUICKTIME PLAYER and that I neede an update in order to watch movies. \r\n\r\nI stupidly installed it thinking this message was coming from the techs at myspace. A day or so later mt windows XP shut down - blue screen saying it closed down and some figures etc. It did so a few times and then I concentrated where I was on the web when it stopped. Well it is everytime I go to Myspace site. Not necessarily into my account but even if I'm just browsing at Myspace window XP stopps with an error message.\r\n\r\nExasperating stuff. Is there any I can do to overcome or rid me of this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nNick D\r\n\r\nWhere can I read a response to this? Can someone email me please."

    "content": "i get plagued by phished people everyday. even ads that are less then legal. quiet a majority of the phished people i encounter actually still have access to there account, and are unaware that some phisher is sending ads around to there friends, i would certainly hate to find out that im in trouble because a phisher was making my accouunt send ilegal ads out to everyone.\r\n\r\nall phishing sites where they ask for your login to steal dont actually say http://www.myspace.com\r\nbut they usually look extremely similar. such as\r\nhttp://www.rnyspace.com\r\n\r\nsystem errors caused by a website are virtually impossible without C++. and C++ cant just be used normally like html or java in the first place. You may want to consider the possibility of a virus or major program corruption, such as quicktime is corrupted.\r\n\r\ni would just like to point out that a mac is much more insecure then a windows machine. ive worked with macs before and they are pathetic security wise. windows recieves probrably 80/100 bad hacker being the leading computer in the market, i think mac would crash and burn in windows place right now.\r\n\r\nin other words its in your best interest to have good virus protection on a mac too."
