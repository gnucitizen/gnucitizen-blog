This will address those users who are unable/unwilling to upgrade to Acrobat/Reader 8.\r\n\r\nWe thank the community for their concern in identifying vulnerabilities in our products and hope that our having the issues already addressed in our current versions will serve to alleviate concerns and demonstrate our commitment to this area.\r\n\r\nLeonard Rosenthol\r\nAdobe Systems"

That is a very serious concern for us.\r\n\r\nMy other concern is that Acrobat Reader is a nightmare to update, it's one of the worst programs we have for deploying updates, and I can see this being a popular attack vector because of it's widespread use and the problems updating it.\r\n\r\nWe'll get Acrobat updated on our computers today, but I wonder how long this vulnerability would have gone quietly unnanounced by Adobe..."
