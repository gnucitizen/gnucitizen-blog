July 10th 2007... 13 days now?\r\n\r\nAnyway Minded Security's advisory is very worth reading, many thanks for the pointer :)\r\n--\r\nThere's a browser safer than Firefox... http://noscript.net"

In fact, I am sure that someone will take it and make into a worm of some sort. BTW, 10x to Stefano and his team responsible disclosure the impact is a lot less significant.\r\n\r\nStefano, always. The research is worthed."

This is a pretty cool idea though seeing as how most services now use Flash players supporting the FLV file format, and generally use some shotty script to get the URL of the media from a variable in the address."
