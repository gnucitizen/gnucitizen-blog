A couple of months ago I was invited by [InformIT](http://www.informit.com) to write an article on Identity 2.0 Security. I am generally interested in this subject so I decided to give it a try. The result is [Identity 2.0: How Attackers Break into Identity-centric Services](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=787262&seqNum=4), which was published yesterday. For those who don't know what Identity 2.0 means, check the following video from [Dick Hardt](http://identity20.com) who was my personal inspiration to get involved into this subject.

Funny enough, Dick has responded to the above article with [Identity 2.0 is insecure?](http://identity20.com/?p=115). In his post he brings some interesting insights where Identity 2.0 is going security-wise. Apart from that, There is a lot more one can say about security in the Web2.0/Identity2.0 world. We are really just at the beginning. I hope that in the following months, I will be able to show my vision of security problems concerning Web2.0 technology.
