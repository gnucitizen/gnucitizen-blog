Several people asked for the OWASP slides for both presentations, [dk's](/files/2007/09/dwk-owasp-day-september-2007.pdf) and [mine](/files/2007/09/pdp-owasp-day-september-2007.pdf), so here they are. Have fun.

On the other hand, we had great fun presenting at OWASP Day Belgium's Mini Con - great organization, great venue and some great talks. The day before that, I presented at OWASP London chapter meeting. It was also great fun, too. Come around next time. You won't be disappointed.
