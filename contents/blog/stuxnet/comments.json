    "content": "Very pretty.  I will happily sit through almost anything that had some good dynamic text stuff going on.  I also haven't really dug into Stuxnet to find out what's real and what isn't, but if everything mentioned in that video is verifiable, then I think we're in a new phase of \"weponized software.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, ouch.  Wouldn't want to be RealTek or Siemens after watching that video."
