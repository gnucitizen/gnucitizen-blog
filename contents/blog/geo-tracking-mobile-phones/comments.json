    "content": "Definitely a payload worth it including on a exploit. \r\n\r\nHowever, I can also see legitimate purposes for this. For instance, why pay a commercial service to track you mobile (in case it gets stolen or you want your family to know where you are), when you can code a small application which retrieves the cell data and translates it to a geographical location using a web service? \r\n\r\nJust another application of this technique worth it considering."

I'd like to instantly see my track on gmaps on my mobile. I would also like to add exif data with the approx. coords. to the snapshots I take with it. Can you show us the way?\r\n\r\nKeep up the creativity and art flowing,\r\nGuillaume"

It knew which SIM was supposed to be in the phone; if the SIM changed (i.e. it was stolen, and the SIM replaced) it would start silently SMS'ing a user-definable list of numbers with the current cell tower details (and obviously its new phone number)."
