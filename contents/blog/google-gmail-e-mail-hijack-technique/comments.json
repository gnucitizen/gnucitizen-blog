Yes, they can cause a severe nuisance.\r\n\r\nWhat I am more concerned about are those with equal or greater talents than the public researchers that are tipped off as to where to look.  As you say, they are few and most of us won't notice when they succeed.  What partial disclosure does is to raise the awareness of those who can exploit a weakness as they WILL know what to look for.\r\n\r\nI am in the full public disclosure camp, following a reasonable private disclosure timeout to the vendor.  While you await a vendor fix in whatever timeline suits you as the discloser, don't tip your hat to the people who have no ethics.\r\n\r\npdp does a great service to the community at large.  My only gripe is that if there is a public disclosure of any kind, make it full so that mitigations can be researched.  If you are working with the vendor and don't want to make a full disclosure because the vendor has not yet fixed the issue, don't publicly disclose at all.  When the vendor either fixes the problem or stops working with you, go for full public disclosure."

And its one of those things thats always going to be around. \n\nSome people use mail server hacks where they can send a email completely from a email like \"support@paypal.com\" and have the paypal page in the email but when you click on the link it goes to there cookie sploiting site instead of people or even worse may collect your login information becuase your too silly to look at the url or they have a URL rewrite filter that makes it look like its paypal. \n\nThe only thing you can do to fight these things. \n\n1. Dont open mail from people you dont know. \n2. If the mail is from a potential customer \"someone you need to meet through email as a new person\" then setup a email address for that flow like sales@mydomain.com Makes sure the mail is scanned for virus and spoof checked. \n3. Use a smaller email provider. Smaller email service providers can take more care in adding custom SPF records and spam filters in the Mail server for your pop and smtp service that checks headers and makes the mail actually comes from what it says its coming from."
