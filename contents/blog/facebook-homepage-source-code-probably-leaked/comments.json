    "content": "Hello,\n\nToday, I read about the alleged source code leak at Facebook Secrets http://facebooksecrets.blogspot.com/ where the actual code was posted...\n\nThe code is composed of numerous API calls, I don't know if the actual code of the various PHP include files was also leaked. Couple of days ago while browsing facebook I got an error that revealed where the actual code is stored /home/... I believe this violates an important security rule \"Secure failure\". Unfortunately many web applications on the web still suffer from an insecure failure.\n\nJust a thought :)"

But there are places in the Web, where you can find this source code :-) (like here: www.mediafire.com/?ddjj9bntdzz).\r\n\r\nYes, there are many web sites (and web applications) in the Internet which suffer from an insecure failure. And security researchers and visitors can find such holes during visiting of the sites or via Google hacking.\r\n\r\npdp and guys, you can look at my article \"Warning\" Google hacking http://websecurity.com.ua/1278/ (about dorks developed by me). Where I describe a lot of \"warning\" search queries (dorks) which let you find Full path disclosure and Information disclosure vulnerabilities at a lot of sites."
