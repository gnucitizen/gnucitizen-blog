j0hnny, Roelof Temmingh and I are currently working on the second edition of Syngress' best selling book [Google Hacking for Penetration Testers](http://www.syngress.com/catalog/?pid=3150). We are all excited about it and we hope that the second edition will be as good or even better then the first edition with an up-to-date information on the latest Google hacks (Google Dorks) and a lot more interesting additions, which we cannot disclose at the moment.

For those who don't know what Google Hacking is or are still skeptical about it, here is what some people say about the first book. This information can be accessed from Syngress's website as well:

> "Understanding the adversary mindset is an important element in designing and developing effective protective strategies." - Amit Yoran, Former Director of the National Cyber Security Division, Department of Homeland Security

> "...Google Hacking exposes those with their pants down, so the whole Internet can see their skivvies." - Adrian Lamo, Special Project Editor, The American River Current

> "This Book Rocks!" - Roelof Temmingh, Technical Director, SensePost (Creators of the Wikto Web Assessment Tool)

> "You can use Google for something other than hacking? I only use Google for finding vulnerable servers." - Tim Mullen, CIO, AnchorIS.com

Meanwhile, I am still waiting for a box full of [XSS Attacks - Cross Site Scripting Exploits and Defence](/blog/xss-attacks-cross-site-scripting-exploits-and-defence) books, which I am going to give away to the GNUCITIZEN readers. We've got some great comments about this book too; check out the Amazon reviews over [here](http://www.amazon.com/Cross-Site-Scripting-Attacks-Exploits/dp/1597491543/ref=sr_1_1/103-8131239-3320616?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1177490664&sr=8-1). So, some great stuff are coming up. A lot of work needs to be done, but at the end it will be all worthed. Stay tuned with the GNUCITIZEN [rss channel](http://www.gnucitizen.org/feed) for more information.
