The Hack in the Box (HITB) conference (Dubai), was all in all great fun. I would like to personally thank Dhillon, Belinda, Amy and everybody else from the HITB crew for making this event possible and making sure that everybody had good time. The devil is in the details and this is what makes HITB the best conference in Asia and the middle-east region. I am anxiously looking forward to visit HITB KL.

It is needless to say that we've made a lot of friends, talked to some of the best minds in the security world, and even had the chance to show some of our work. Adrian presented his talk on "Cracking into Embedded Devices" for the first time. You can download his slides from [here](/files/2008/04/cracking-into-embedded-devices-hitb-dubai-2008.pdf). I repeated my Client-side hacking talk from [Black Hat Europe 2008](/blog/black-hat-europe-2008/) but with a few modifications. You can download the slides from [here](/files/2008/04/Client-side-Security-Slides-HITB.pdf). The actual paper can be downloaded from [here](/blog/black-hat-europe-2008).

Again, the event was great. The amount of effort the HITB crew put into the preparation was evident all the way till the end.
