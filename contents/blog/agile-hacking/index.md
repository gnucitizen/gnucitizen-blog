> Help us create the best hacking reference/manual/book ever made. We provide the scene, the resources and the money, and you keep the credits and the control over the eventual profits. Read on.

During the next couple of months we are open for your submissions. The idea is to [harvest the knowledge of the crowds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) in order to create the best hacker manual ever made. The process is very simple. We, as well as you, will commit new hacks, tips, tricks and techniques in the field of information security to our system. Each hack will be published under its author's Name and URL (blog, site, etc) on the blog under the title and category of "Agile Hacking". Once we have a good enough number of hacks, we will tip some money in, in order to make our mutual work into a book, which will preserve all the credits of its authors. The book will be available for a free download but also as a hard/soft cover printed version. If the book makes some money, you will decide how to spend them. It just cannot get better then that.

> "Agile Hacking" like in quick and well-coordinated in movement or marked by an ability to think quickly, mentally acute or aware. Overall, a breathtaking experience. Keep it small, keep it simple, keep it agile!

For now, the entire thing will take the form of a mailing list which was build for the sole purpose. We would like to keep the process as simple and transparent as possible. However, if the crowd decides that this mechanism is inefficient, we will move to a more robust system. Keep in mind that the point is to harvest the knowledge of the crowd. If you want to be involved with managing the process, let us know. After all, it is a free/open project and everybody is equal.
