    "content": "defcon, I like your passion and I like your idea to start a Wiki. I agree with you, wiki seems to be the right type of platform for this type of project. Although, there are many wikies that were created for similar purposes and none of them are as active as we would like them to be. The reason for this is because content grows old with time.\r\n\r\nThis is why, after careful consideration, we decided that by keeping the content chunked into small pieces, loosely joined, each one of which self-contained in a blog post, we will provide an agile platform which everybody will benefit from and no one will be pressured by the burden to main unmaintainable content and assure quality.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as you said. Most of the things on the Web are old so we should not start something that may eventually fade away with time. You, as well as me, would rather ensure the dynamics of this project.\r\n\r\nLet's keep it simple for now and see how it goes. If at some point the crowd decides that a Wiki is a better platform, we will start using that. What do u think?"

If you talk about a forum where people can exchange and discuss ideas (sec related), those stuff exists too (e.g. governmentsec). For new exploits or 0days follow the mailinglists like bugtrack. And there are even good mailinglists for pentesters around.\n\nSo what I basically want to say is that you have just to use already existent sources. If you really stick to the idea of that wiki, think about the maintenance problem. Even the real wiki got some of that issues.\n\nJust my 2 cents\nDeblin"
