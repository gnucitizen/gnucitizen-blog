For example, putting it on a myspace page.. then using your double proxy iframes method to extract it. You can put it on anyy site that allows user content - forums, comments, wordpress, etc. Assuming it can handle the bandwidth of a worm.\r\n\r\n-maluc"

Get the base64 value and append the following in front of it: data:application/x-shockwave-flash;base64,. Put that into an iframe src attribute and you have the flash running. This doesn't work on IE though. More on that <a href=\"http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/self-contained-xss-attacks\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/a-bag-full-of-tricks\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\n\n<blockquote>... but there's a lot of ways to use remote storage ... you can put it on any site that allows user content</blockquote>\n\nYes I agree on that, but I want something that is more agile, as I said in this post. I want to create a virtual file system that the agent can operate without requiring assistance. This is where tinyurl shines: everyone is free to shrink, no registration is required."
