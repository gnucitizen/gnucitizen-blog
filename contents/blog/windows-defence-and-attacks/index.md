Couple of years ago me and some of my friends had to do a [presentation](http://www.gnucitizen.org/static/blog/2006/06/windows-defence-and-attacks.swf) on common Windows related attacks. The presentation is all flash based. You need to use the keyboard arrows to navigate your way through the slides.

**NOTE** Keep in mind that some of the topics covered in this presentation might be a little bit outdated.
