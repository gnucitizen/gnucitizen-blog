This [year's OWASP Europe](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Europe_2008_-_Belgium) event was based in Ghent, Belgium. I had to take an early train from London to Brussels, which is by the way dead easy from where I live. As usual the event was excellent.

Now there were a few funny things but the most funnies of all was that I've got flagged by Seba for having a sales pitch within my slides. Actually, my intentions were totally different. Moreover, it is silly to sell very niche services to wide-range of Web app guys. I will never do that. Not to mention I don't have to do that.

So my apologies for the confusions, it was meant to be funny, not rude.
