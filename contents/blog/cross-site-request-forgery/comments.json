However, imagine a CSRF attack combined with persistent XSS: every time the victim visits the page with the injected code, the attacker can force the browser to do actions on behalf of the victim without social engineering required!\r\n\r\nPersistent (server-side) XSS + CSRF = killer (IMHO)\r\n\r\nThat's why it's very important for developers that it is always assumed that current authenticated sessions might currently be controlled by attackers (i.e.: ask for the previous password when allowing the user to change it to a new one - same thing goes for updating the user's email address)\r\n\r\nAs in for CSRF attacks that require social engineering to somehow trick the user to be authed when visiting the page with the evil XSS, the way I always pictured the attack is through an email that tells the victim some BS in order to get him to login before visiting the evil URL. Of course this email should appear to come from the target entity (just like phishing emails). People like good deals and free things, so this is something I would aim for when social engineering users to get them CSRFed successfully.\r\n\r\nGood post pdp."

You are right that these types of attacks are not targeted, but you can hit a lot of random web users by spawning splogs for example. That's why the WEB is the perfect medium for spreading worms."

Suddenly you reach a page that is a bit malicious. You don't know about that so you happily continue browsing around. Unfortunately, what have just happened is your network being exposed to attackers. How? Well, you have visited a page that contains a CSRF vector for you router located at 192.168.1.1/192.168.0.1. You router admin interface is now exposed to the Internet. All attackers need to do is to collect your IP which is already logged on their server and access the admin interface.

    "content": "heh, no worries...\r\n\r\nThe purpose of CSRF is to perform actions on behalf of the current user but this user must be authenticated first. Otherwise, there is no point in doing whatsoever.\r\n\r\nOk, here is another one: let's say that an attacker wants to transfer some money to his/her account. They start a splog network which is backdoored from top to bottom with malicious JavaScript. The attacker targets several banks at the same time. So he/she has CSRF for Lloyds, Natwest, HSBC and some other bank. Once an unaware user visits any page from this splog network a CSRF will be executed to all bank sites initiating a money transfer. Most of the requests will fail, however, if the current user is unlucky enough to have their account open at the same time, or they forgot to logoff, the transfer will be successful.\r\n\r\nAs pagvac, put it very clear, CSRF in combination with persistent XSS could be quite dangerous. Why? Well, let's say that someone targets MySpace with a similar exploit as the one discussed above. A worm like that could reach a critical mass in less then an hour effecting millions of users. Even if only 0.5% of them have their account open, the attacker could collect substantial amount of money.\r\n\r\nSometimes I see that attack vectors discussed in this blog are tried for real. I've seen some of them in the wild. The <a href=\"http://www.websense.com/securitylabs/alerts/alert.php?AlertID=708\" rel=\"nofollow\">QuickTime attack on MySpace</a> is just one of them. I hope that you won't try this thing at home. Right?"

While I would say that *most* router's web interfaces are vulnerable to CSRF, not all are. For instance, BT Voyager 2091 router adds a token to all admin HTTP requests that change configuration settings. \r\n\r\ni.e.:\r\n\r\nhttp://192.168.1.1/lancfg2.cgi?checkNum=6418&amp;ethIpAddress=192.168.1.1&amp;ethSubnetMask=255.255.255.0&amp;hostname=voyager&amp;domainname=home&amp;enblLan2=0&amp;lan2IpAddress=0.0.0.0&amp;lan2SubnetMask=255.255.255.255&amp;lanmtu=1500\r\n\r\nIn this case the attacker needs to know the value of 'checkNum' when CSRFing, which is really assigned from the variable 'randomNum' within a JS snippet. 'randomNum' changes each time a page is loaded. YES, I'm sure that you can reverse engineer the router and figure out how the random token is generated (especially since the software is open source), but the point here is that BT kept in mind CSRF attacks when designing the web interface for Voyager 2091.\r\n\r\nI do believe that routers' web interfaces will be designed in the future using randomly-generated tokens for all configuration requests. But since now most people don't have a damn clue what CSRF is and why it can be bad thing, there is still a lot of opportunities (and time) for exploitation."
