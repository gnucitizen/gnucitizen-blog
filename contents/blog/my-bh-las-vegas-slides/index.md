I believe that some of you may be interested to see my [Black Hat slides](/blog/my-black-hat-talk/). If you are not aware yet, the GNUCITIZEN [Lab](http://lab.gnucitizen.org) domain is now up. The [slides](http://lab.gnucitizen.org/presentations/Client-side-Security-BH-Las-Vegas-2008.pdf?attredirects=0) have been there since yesterday. The next post is all about the QuickTime vulnerability which I partially-disclosed over [here](/blog/quicktime-0day-for-vista-and-xp/).

**UPDATE 2011/04/21**: I included alternative download location.
