    "content": "I think that your approach is very interesting. I've never heard of mailinator but it seamed to be a quite interesting service. Good stuff!\r\n\r\nOne thing that I would like to point out is that mailinator supports RSS feeds as well:\r\n\r\n<pre><code>http://mailinator.com/rss.jsp?email=myrandomusername</code></pre>\r\n\r\nso, it might be easier to extract all email entries with wget/curl in combination with the <a href=\"http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XMLStarlet toolkit</a> or just grep/awk. Also, GMail supports RSS through the GData services. However, we need cookies for that. So yes, your approach is definitely cleaner. I love it.\r\n\r\nHere is probably the place to mention that client-side security issues can expand across the traditional boundaries that they currently reside at. I can foresee a worm that can send XSS payloads over email and as such propagate. This is possible due to the existence of services such as mailinator and others that can transform RSS to email, email to RSS, etc. I am planning to release a paper on that soon, so stay tuned."

    "content": "MadCyril:\r\n\r\nI agree, this can be done with scripting languages like Perl, Ruby or Python. However, wouldn't you rather reduce the number of lines of code to 5 by using a public site (mailinator in this case) that simplifies your work.\r\n\r\nTominator:\r\n\r\nSometimes the password might be more valuable. Imagine a forum site. The database simply holds public info. Now imagine the admin can see my password in the clear. Since most people reuse passwords he could now try the same password on the email I used to register (which he can see in the clear).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, some people use site-based patterns for their passwords. i.e.:\r\n\r\nMYPASS_4_www.forumsite.org\r\n\r\nIn this case the admin who can see my pw in the clear could try using my username on amazon and the following password:\r\n\r\nMYPASS_4_www.amazon.com\r\n\r\nThe point is, whenever it's feasible for information to be protected it should be. I personally don't want dodgy admins looking up my password :) but yes you're right, other sensitive data is usually in the clear anyways."
