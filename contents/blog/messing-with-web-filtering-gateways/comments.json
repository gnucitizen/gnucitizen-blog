    "content": "I threw together a 5-part series on bypassing web filters, and I missed some of these. There are indeed a myriad of ways. Some others worth mentioning:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Web-Enabled RSS (Google Reader, yahoo pipes, etc)</li>\r\n<li>Out-of-band (EV-DO, Neighboring WiFi, etc)</li>\r\n<li>Web-Enabled Anonymizers (PHP Proxy, Megaproxy)</li>\r\n<li>Wide-open public proxies on Port 80 (e-pr0xy.com for lists of these)</li>\r\n<li>Tunneling (SSH, ICMP, SSL/HTTP)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIndeed, it's quite hard to keep people from accessing content that they really, really want to access. Good write-up."

    "content": "In my high school the admins block \"internet traffic\" using dans guardian to filter http requests. I noticed how I could freely use ftp or ssh so I'm using a couple of \"header distorcing proxies\" to bypass the filter: one application runs on the pc i'm using at school increasing by one the value of each letter of the first word in the headers ( HTTP -&gt; IUUQ ) and then passing the stream to a remote proxy which shifts the header back ( IUUQ -&gt; HTTP ). The reverse is done for incoming responses.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this? Every feedback is welcomed!!"
