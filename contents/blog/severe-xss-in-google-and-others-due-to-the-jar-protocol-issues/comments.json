My friendly advise to you is to open your mind a little bit and stop being a sheep. Security is such a vast topic. Restricting yourself one single thing wont bring you anything good and will make you sound retarded. So, keep up with your instincts but do not judge things that you simple don't understand."

    "content": "@vaj\r\n\r\nshellcode isn't complex, it only takes huge amounts of time to construct a correct payload, and that payload could chnage due to some conditions, and might not work all the time. So no mumbo jumbo about \"hacking\" and \"shellcode\" because it looks difficult, while it really isn't. The principles behind it are easy to grasp.\r\n\r\nI understand what message you try to send here, but you can't say hacking is \"this\" or \"that\". Mainly for the fact that most buffer overflows all work the same, the creation of shellcode is only a process, just like programming is. If you like spending countless hours attaching crashing programs to a debugger, in order to construct decent shellcode, well that's your kick then.\r\n\r\nI do agree however that the \"jar\" issue isn't bad. I don't think it's such a big issue, but that is my opinion. For the reason that a) I knew about it. b) Firefox/extensions boot up out jars. c) It's actually used for a signed javascript archives for years. d) never trust content."
