I don't know how much money I can steal from Bruce's bank account, but I know any teenager will be more then happy to run his BitTorrent client from his IP!"

    "content": "@shitbull - haven't you seen Defcon's wall of sheep? You would think that people that assist a hacking/infosec event would know better, but the amount of passwords sniffed from cleartext protocols speaks for itself! I remember being wowed when seeing several big consulting firms domains among the email accounts compromised.\r\n\r\nRegarding invalid SSL cert dialog boxes, users *are* used to accept them most of the times since even legitimate sites make browsers show such dialog boxes. ie: due to not trusted CA, expired certificate or even missmatching between the site's domain name and cert's CN field. Plus, as I said, cookies travel in the clear on most sites. The amount of auth data traveling in the clear when we're online is crazy.\r\n\r\n1. Get gmail cookie via wifi sniffing @ starbucks (gmail downgrades to HTTP after authenticating)\r\n2. Add a filter that forwards victim's emails to the attacker's\r\n3. Start compromising victim's online identify by requesting \"reset/recover password\" emails from all sites the victim accesses\r\n\r\nIn my opinion there is a clear problem here.\r\n\r\n@Daniel - perhaps the reason why a lack of common sense is present on Bruce's article is because he's helping his employer (BT) promote the new FON service."

    "content": "Hi... i agree with all of you here... wireless has many problems of security including industrial standards, bad user configurations, hardware limitations and many others. But... if i don't pay attention in my own AP router ... i believe that i am surrendering my self to many  threats, and this is not what we intend to do right? If we follow the idea of forget the security of ours  owns APs, probably we will have many problems coming soon. I a country that has laws that can arrest someone  for web attacks, i believe that is not good try to explain in court that \"someone\" was using your AP  (\"Internet\") to attack some target. Imaging that the \"wireless signal thief\" has successful, against a \"big target\" like something that can stop a public service or against a government piece , and some cops come to knock in your door in the middle of the night!       \r\n\r\nI prefer to keep protecting my own AP as i its possible, and donÂ´t use free hotspots. \r\n\r\nAnd to finish here... nice post Adrian."

    "content": "@Quake - So you always leave legitimate sites that show invalid certificates? Or do you actually take your time to find out the very reason why your browser complains about an \"invalid\" cert?\r\n\r\nOf course you can force gmail to remain on SSL by accessing the site through a https URL. However, this is not the default. In other words, only geeks would bother to type \"https://\", which means that most users' gmail sessions travel in the clear after logging in.\r\n\r\nEven the \"My Account\" homepage of google uses the cleartext http version of the gmail (\"http://mail.google.com/mail\") URL: https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageAccount"
