    "content": "This is interesting but I'd like to see an actual working example. My Dojo Storage flash code, for example, must be invoked and loaded on page load since it depends on a document.write; I'm not sure if a dynamic SCRIPT tag could invoke it and set it up. If the original domain already has Dojo Storage or the given flash file then that is one thing, but what if it doesn't?"

Of course that is not sufficient.\r\n\r\nSoon there will be an examples as well and I am planning to do this in the 0.9 release of AttackAPI. Thanks for the comment."
