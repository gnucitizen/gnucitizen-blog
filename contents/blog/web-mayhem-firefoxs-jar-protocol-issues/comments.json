I think it's unbelievable that such high impact issues take so much time to fix!!\r\n\r\nJust a suggestion to Moz-Devs: \r\nAt least as a quick and dirty fix, add in about:config a flag option which prevents remote site to use data: and jar: and chrome: and whatever. One option for each proprietary/odd uri scheme.\r\n\r\noh, standards answers like \"use noscript\" will be redirected to /dev/null.\r\n\r\nAgain kudos to Pdp :)"

    "content": "I see a few other issues here.\r\n\r\nFirst, there's a problem in the basic design of the handler. Conceptually, the file is not accessed through a \"jar:\" protocol, the fact that the file can contain content is an attribute of the file. It's the MIME type of the file that should result in the file being treated as a JAR file:\r\n\r\nhttp&#58;//example.com/path/to/file.jar#/path/inside/jar/file.html...\r\n\r\nThis would have avoided this problem right from the start.\r\n\r\nSecond, allowing arbitrary access to the contents of untrusted archives in any context is dangerous. Apple's been burned by this, Microsoft's been burned by this. What is the benefit of this handler that makes the risk worthwhile?\r\n\r\nThird: assuming this is allowed, the file should be treated as part of the directory tree of the hosting site. If it's redirected, that's the site in the redirect, not the site in the original URL. Are there other situations in Firefox where the original URL rather than the redirected URL are used for this purpose?"

No one needs to fix anything except Mozilla. Someone needs to be fired, and that someone is actually so many people. FF credibility is ruined *forever* (or until this team is fired for good)."
