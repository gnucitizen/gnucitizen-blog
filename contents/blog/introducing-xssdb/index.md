In a recent post [David K suggested](/blog/self-contained-xss-attacks/#comment-125) that the XSS cheat sheet hosted at [ha.ckers.org](http://ha.ckers.org) is not as accessible as it should be.

> RSnake, I didn't even know this attack vector was in your cheat sheet and I have been through it loads of times - A table of contents might be cool.

Over the weekend I composed a [simple AJAX applications to provide a better way of previewing all attack vectors](/blog/xssdb) from RSnake's Cross-site scripting cheat sheet. RSnake has been working on it for quite long time and I really like what he has done so far.

I am planning to extend the attack database with some of my own findings, keeping the original database updated and intact. I am also working on some features that will allow user submissions so the community is able to provide some feedback as well.

_Any comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Currently XSSDB works in Firefox only. The application almost works in IE6 and IE7. There seams to be something wrong with Opera._
