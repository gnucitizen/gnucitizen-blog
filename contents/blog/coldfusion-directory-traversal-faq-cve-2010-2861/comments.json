The CF8 login screen does this: <code>onSubmit=\"cfadminPassword.value = hex_hmac_sha1(salt.value, hex_sha1(cfadminPassword.value));\"</code>\n\nThis allows attackers to authenticate using the hash instead of cracking it."

    "content": "Lucas: there are many ways to do this, blocking the URL with a WAF is one of them. Also, you can do it on the web server itself. For instance, on Apache you could add the following to the config file:\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Location /CFIDE&gt;\nOrder Deny,Allow\nDeny from all\nAllow from 127.0.0.1\n&lt;/Location&gt;</code></pre>\n\nJust make sure you test the new configuration settings thoroughly before placing the server into production. For instance, some non-admin features rely on access to /CFIDE/ . E.g.: charts (cfchart) requires access to /CFIDE/GraphData.cfm. Take a look at the ColdFusion lockdown guide for more info: http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/whitepapers/pdf/91025512_cf9_lockdownguide_wp_ue.pdf"

Think about it, the login form simply hashes the password entered by the user with the value of the 'salt' parameter as returned by the application within client-side JS code. You can replicate all these steps yourself without needing to know the plaintext password."

For long time I have been using a password with space at the beginning and end of the alphanumerical characters.\r\n\r\ne.g- â€ passwd â€ But actually Gmail doesnâ€™t count if there is spaces at the beginning and end of the password. Basically you could use the space character as much as you like at the beginning and end with actual password, still you can sign in. I couldnâ€™t find any article related to this â€¦ But I could exploit this feature(!) at times when some one try to count the number of characters in the password, by adding some spaces."
