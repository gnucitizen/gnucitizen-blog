Yes, that way the company that is legally buying them, will make less money.... but this is the only way to fish out the \"blackhats\" and get them to work on the white market - give them more money for doing it legally (not more than they would do with a crime, but good enough to consider the lack of risk). \n\nYet... how could we accomplish this? Me thinks.. only by refusing to sell 0days for less than 5000K a piece."

If you provide an exploit though, their work will be easier and therefore you will get paid more. Writing an exploit is the process of weaponizing a bug. No company, in their clear mind and without breaking the law and rising too much suspicion, will buy exploits. This is the fundamental difference which I think we all should agree on."

    "content": "There can be a big difference between a PoC exploit and a \"weaponized\" exploit.  Some level of exploitability research is necessary to properly gauge the risk of the vulnerability.  \r\n\r\nThere is a big difference in the amount of danger presented by a bug with a MSRC Exploitability Index of 1 (consistent exploit code likely) versus 3 (functioning exploit code unlikely).  1's are the types of bugs that turn into malware attacks.\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to prevent actual attacks (not just trump up vulnerability counts), you want to address the 1's first and de-prioritize the 3's.  Having someone perform the exploitability research is the best way to separate the wheat from the chaff.\r\n\r\nI agree with Alexander, that the best way to make less vulnerabilities end up in the hands of malware groups is to give researchers enough of an incentive to \"do the right thing\".  $75K versus $0 (vendor) or $5k (ZDI) is a simple decision.  Look at the success of the iTunes Store (now the #1 music seller in the USA).  Give people a convenient and properly priced avenue and most will do the right thing.\r\n\r\n-Dino"

    "content": "First of all the analogy with Apple Music store is flawed. The entire music industry is in decline. Perhaps Apple are the biggest music seller in the USA but what size of a market we are talking about? The music industry measures not only by number of song they sell but also other things such as video, music channels, concerts, merchandise, etc.\n\nDino, from purely business perspective, $75K is an impossible sum to get out of a vendor or a vulnerability disclosure program. For that amount of money any company can outsource a whole team of researchers specializing finding vulnerabilities in a single product. Also keep in mind that there are many hungry but extremely gifted people out there. If someone is willing to put $75K for a vulnerability, there will be many people outbidding each other.\n\nThe only people who will pay $75K are those who are interested in a fully functional exploit for whatever reasons they may need it. Just keep in mind criminal organizations always have more money to offer regardless how much you price legitimately disclosed vulnerabilities. If a company offers a bounty of 75K per exploit, a criminal organization will out bid by 3-4 times that figure. How much a vulnerability is worth to the vendor? Not as much as they would like to admit!"

Security companies can't do that -- this money is basically thrown down the sink, as they cannot recover those expenses. It simply doesn't make at least economical sense to do just that, let alone solving the actual problem.\r\n\r\nIf there's no demand for paying for vulnerability information, nobody would be selling. Of course, that still does not eliminate the illegal market, but paying for bugs will not remove it as well, but will instead legalize it.

Now you've got things like ASLR, NX pages, canary values on the stack, SELinux and stuff. Provided that you are not likely to find memory pages that are executable and writable, you don't know the exact address of your shellcode (because memory layout is randomized) and you just can't overrun the return address on the stack cause you don't know the canary value, today writing BOF exploits (at least on linux) is a kind of art. Still possible, but much harder and sometimes not reliable. Come on, it's 2009 now. Aleph1's times are long gone (and for good IMO). Don't know about the Microsoft world though, probably it's easier there. \r\n\r\nThus, I don't think a couple of underpaid Chinese 'hackers' will be so much productive in that aspect.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as far as web vulnerabilities are concerned, I totally agree with you that's a very possible scenario.

And even then you gotta really think about what government you're selling it too as it can actually screw up your career due to international politics. ie: .uk researcher selling vulns + working exploits to the .cn government.\n\nRegarding 'hacker' romanticism, pentesting, exploit writing and vuln research in general are nothing other than 1) spotting the crap that other people forgot to clean, and 2) proving that not cleaning your crap can lead to a problem.\n\nAlthough i love offensive security in general, i must say that sometimes i feel like changing careers and becoming a hotel manager in sunny southern spain :) Security research is very interesting, but no one gives a darn ultimately."

This approach will not only backfire soon but also it will undermine all of our hard work. I don't mind if you can get paid 75K for a bug. If you can and you are happy with the terms of the deal than you should do it. What I do mind is the whole <q>no more free bugs</q> campaigning.\n\nWhat the <q>no more free bugs</q> campaign promotes is not to disclose critical information unless certain demands are met. It sounds ridiculous and terribly wrong!\n\nAlso, it is pretty subjective to talk about how much Apple and other software and hardware vendors are willing to pay for a bug. Keep in mind that if they know that a vulnerability in their products worths $75K they would have had a proper bounty program. As far as I know, Mozilla is one of the few vendors which offer bounties for bugs and they are not paying that much, i.e. you are not going to get rich.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I hear that ZDI has bought some vulnerabilities for at least $50K in some instances. I am not sure if this is true but if it is than I guess the market is finding its own way to justify the cost. However, if bugs can be sold to vendors for $50K than why should anyone bother with pwn2own competitions where you are making a lot less then that?"

    "content": "The solution to this dilemma seems obvious.  Instead of paying security researchers per bug found, pay them by the hour, or put them on salary.  Pay full time security researchers around $75K a year (depending on skill and time worked), pay for their health care, a 401K, and/or other customary benefits in their country, instead of paying them per bug.  Then the bugs get released when they are found, and shared with all other security researchers, and researchers get paid for their work.  \r\n\r\nThis system is preferable for most people to getting paid a lot per bug because if offers long term financial security for the researcher.  Most people wouldn't risk a decent job for quick cash, and since selling bugs to shady 3rd parties would get them fired, as well as the other the potential consequences you mentioned, they'd have a big incentive not to do it.\r\n\r\nThey could pay non-professionals something for submitting bugs, but the biggest incentive for a non-salary researcher to submit bugs would be to prove they're worth hiring.\r\n\r\nThis is the system most academic disciplines use and works for most of them."
