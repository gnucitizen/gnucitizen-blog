Oh yes, the digital battlefield is taking unusual shapes. The latest manifestation of cyber warfare is a conflict between the Adblock Plus and the NoScript extensions. The [story goes](http://adblockplus.org/blog/attention-noscript-users) that NoScript used some JavaScript tactics and, of course, some obfuscations in order to cripple the Adblock Plus functionalities. This attack was a response to Adblock Plus blocking NoScript ads which you see when you upgrade the extension, which as you know happens quite regularly, don't know why.

The conflict seems to be resolved now to one degree or another but it is interesting to observe the whole situation and also draw important conclusions. Therefore, I've got several points I would like to bring to the table:

1. More examples of similar nature will follow. Keep an eye on Facebook, Apple AppStore, Firefox and other platforms that allow 3rd-party components to be displayed, downloaded and executed.
2. [As I mentioned before](/blog/firefox-malware/), a malicious piece of JavaScript code (even an obvious obfuscation) can be quite easily smuggled into harmlessly looking Firefox extensions. If I may speculate, the situation is the same for other similar platforms.
3. Unless platform vendors do something about it, they could become the next hot spot for all sorts of interesting malware.

It is also very interesting to see the extend to which extension developers will go in order to protect their userbase. After all, larger userbase equals more money. And with [more people looking to quickly cache in](http://blog.trailofbits.com/2009/03/22/no-more-free-bugs/), the battlefield is truly changing for better or worse.
