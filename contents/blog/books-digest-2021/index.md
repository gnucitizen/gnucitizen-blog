## How do I choose what to read next

There between 600,000 and 1,000,000 books published in the USA alone every year. So, without any filter, you can easily get to spend time on books that probably do not matter in the long run. I try not to buy books that are not at least 5-10 years old. Most of the books I read come as recommendations from people that I like and trust. I buy more books than I can feasibly read so that I have options.

I believe books are the cheapest form of education one can get, so I go big on this investment.

## When I read

The best time to read is before going to bed. Not only I have a great night rest but also plenty of good thoughts in the morning. The second best time is while commuting to maximize idle time. I can easily read about 30 books per year if I read 1 hour a day while on the train.

## How do I read

Unless I approach fiction, I do not need to read books from cover to cover. The best way to read non-fiction books is to familiarise yourself with the contents by scanning the pages paying attention to titles, introductions, summaries, etc. After that, I can start from whichever part feels most natural to me. Often that is at the beginning of the book, as the author intended, but sometimes I want to jump forward and read the most interesting part first and then go back to the beginning.

When I read, I take notes with my phone. The Notes.app on iPhone has a feature that allows me to scan pages. It is a great way to collect valuable material you can go back to later. Taking good notes is a skill that you can learn with practice and a bit of patience. Once you get the hang of it, it will be very natural activity.
