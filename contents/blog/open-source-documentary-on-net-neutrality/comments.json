The Web is free for all of us. Everyone has the potentials to become opinion former/maker. This is exactly what big media corporations don't like."

    "content": "Interesting video. I saw quite a few articles/etc in net neutrality last year, and this is how I've come to see it:\r\n\r\nNet Neutrality exists, and needs to exist because we do not trust large organisations to act in the public interest. And rightly so, since they have done nothing to gain our trust.\r\n\r\nAnd that's not going to change, and so it needs to stay regulated. Or at least that's my view. Not that I have any say in it, since its a US law.\r\n\r\nOh, and why does inventing something automatically make a person's opinion important? Sure, they created something, people liked it and developed things around the idea, but I my view that doesn't make their opinion any more valid than anyone else's."
