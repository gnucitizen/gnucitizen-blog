This is not necessarily news anymore since it was [discussed](http://blog.websecurify.com/2011/08/websecurify-for-iphone-preview.html) on the Websecurify official blog but we are so excited about it that we could not hold ourselves from posting it here too.

The testing engine used in this particular version of Websecurify is optimized to run with the least possible amount of memory. The results of the scanner are as good as those produced by all other Websecurify variants although in some cases it may miss some statistically unlikely types of issues. This is not directly and only applicable to the iPhone version. No! Similar tradeoffs are also present even in standard desktop/server based scanners although they are usually less visible and obscured behind tones of options. The bottom line is that the scanner not only runs natively on the iOS but also works as expected.

> Now this is exciting! Websecurify is the first in the world mobile web application testing technology.
