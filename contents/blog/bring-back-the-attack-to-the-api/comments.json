    "content": "I started a project named \"Anehta\" on Google Code. Which is a xss attack platform.It contains a javascript file called \"anehta.js\" which had implemented most of the attackAPI's feature. I call my project a \"platform\" but not \"framework\" because I use PHP to implement some server-side features.So it's more than what attackAPI is.\r\n\r\nYou can visit my project here: http://anehta.googlecode.com\r\n\r\nThe version under developing is 0.6.0 and have a better UI.\r\n\r\nI wrote some documents on my blog: http://hi.baidu.com/aullik5 \r\n\r\nand some demo videos here: http://hi.baidu.com/aullik5/blog/item/cb4cd5899283b093a4c272a9.html\r\n\r\nbut I didn't have enough time to translate docs into English , so all the docs are in Chinese at the moment. This work may be done later. In my plan, I will write some flash AS, java applet or something else to implement more powerful features. If you have some advise, feel free to write to me."
