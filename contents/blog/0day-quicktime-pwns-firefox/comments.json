(I'm paraphrasing the alert warning from memory)\r\n\r\nEven if I do click Yes on that alert then Firefox tries to open a URL on http://mozilla.org, not a local file or chrome type URL or whatever you are trying to do as an exploit, and all that results is a 404 file not found.\r\n\r\nSo it appears that Firefox on the Mac is not vulnerable to this after all."

Petkov reported that QuickTime Media-Link files contain a qtnext attribute that could be used on Windows systems to launch the default browser with arbitrary command-line options. When the default browser is Firefox 2.0.0.6 or earlier use of the -chrome option allowed a remote attacker to run script commands with the full privileges of the user. This could be used to install malware, steal local data, or otherwise corrupt the victim's computer.\"\r\n[...]\r\n\"To protect Firefox users from this problem we have now eliminated the ability to run arbitrary script from the command-line. Other command-line options remain, however, and QuickTime Media-link files could still be used to annoy users with popup windows and dialogs until this issue is fixed in QuickTime.\r\n\r\nThis QuickTime issue appears to be the one described by CVE-2006-4965 but the fix Apple applied in QuickTime 7.1.5 does not prevent this version of the problem.\""

    "content": "Notes to several other comment posters:\r\n\r\n1. This exploit only works if Firefox is the default browser.  It doesn't matter what browser you use, only the default browser matters for this one.\r\n\r\n2. The example exploits on this page use the security hole to launch some programs that are part of Windows.  To test the exploits on Mac, Linux, BSD etc. you would need to change those strings in the exploits to name programs from those systems.\r\n\r\n3. Firefox 2.0.0.7 removed the command line option used by these exploits.\r\n\r\n4. The real issue is that when QuickTime sees a URL inside a movie or song, it passes the url text to the command line of whatever is the default browser in a way which allows passing arbitrary text to the browser command line.  In the old Firefox 2.0.0.6 browser this allowed access to the -chrome option.  But any browser whose command line parser can be tricked into doing dangerous stuff from nonsense URLs can be exploited.\r\n\r\n5. Firefox 2.0.0.7 is just a stopgap workaround for the specific exploits on this page.  The real issue is that the generic \"open default browser\" action in the operating system and class libraries needs to ensure that whatever is passed on to the browser process is a single argument which does not look like an option or contains spaces or shell metacharacters.  I don't have the Quicktime source code, so I don't know which interface they use to pass the qtnext string to the browser.  But I am certain that the strings found in the exploits should not have made it through the kind of basic security sanitation filters recommended in GNU/UNIX secure programming tutorials for decades."

One week ago, I got a Trojan, my Word documents were erratic, the Firewall antivirus detected nothing..MS were of no help beyond checking that my softwares were legal. I first got a paid Plus version of my AdAware, which promptly got erratic too, but detected and deleted a MRU. After I had tried to watch a YouTube [professional] video, I had noticed a QT icone come out of nowhere [my son installed iTunes on my laptop, which I never use - and Yes, I browse as an administrator, not knowing any better].  After AdAware, I also switched to Firefox, feeling fed-up with MS generally, and from checking on NoScript, I now got on your QT bug page - it tallies. WHAT DO I DO NOW? I guess this is of no interest to you [except as further proof on Windows users being morons!]but please direct me to people who can answer me: you are the only source of clear information I could get till now.
