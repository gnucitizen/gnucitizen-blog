    "content": "Nice research. I'd like to add that some VoIP phones come with intercom mode enabled by default. This means that by sending it a special SIP request (using the SIP header: <code>Call-Info: ; answer-after=0</code>), one can monitor what is being said in the room, just by calling the phone, as the phone automatically answers the call and puts it thru the speakerphone. One example of such a phone is the Linksys SPA941 (which in its older firmware versions used to have the intercom mode enabled by default). There are probably others that come with this \"feature\" enabled by default and there is always the possibility that one could use an XSS/CSRF to enable it if disabled."

If you managed a CSRF attack to factory default the phone, better yet, a scripted attack that could scan a whole subnet, find the Snom phones and pass the HTTP GET, you're looking at a significant outage."

The reason I ask is that I haven't done much personally on going through the SIP traces trying to figure out if it's possible to grab version and vulnerability info on the SIP server, proxy, SBC, whatever the phone is registering to. \r\n\r\nso consider, by getting to the phonoe itself I can draw out application version info and hardware specific info (MAC, etc.) on the specific phone as well call history, possibly SIP credentials. Flip that around, what if I can draw out information about the proxy or registrar common to ALL phones within a business and find an attack vector? Goes a little beyond a simple XSS attack I think but something maybe worth looking into. Would also potentially be much a much wider attack surface for MITM and spearphishing attacks. Alright, I'm going to stop the use of jargon and acronyms now because it's begining to annoy even me."

They indeed do have a large number of vulnerabilities BUT, the firmware is open source(not many people know this). Thus you could go fix it yourself if you do stumble upon a bug that needs immediate attention.\r\n\r\nAlso it might be worth mentioning, a lot of VOIP-platforms are ran on a popular piece of software called Asterisk(or distros using Asterisk such as FreePBX/CentPBX/Elastix/Trixbox/etc). \r\n\r\nYou'd be amazed exactly how many vulnerabilities are in their software that can easely result in bankruptcy."

I had pretty good discussions with the developers of the snom web interface and I got a preview on the new phone firmware. It definite has been improved a lot and I got a phone for my private lab to test for more issues. \r\n\r\nSo my impression of this day is a good thumbs up to snom - let's see what can be found in the most recent firmware ;)"

Snom says otherwise; only if you have failed to set a password on it (obviously). I came here from the Snom security announcement which downplays this attack. This worries me gravely.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand this article is light on details. The only code is how to make calls once you're in, which would be unrelated to the actual attack.\r\n\r\nNow that the manufacturer has responded, can you please publish more information so we can properly determine if we are at risk?"

    "content": "@Jonas: put it this way, if the attacker can talk to the Snom's IP phone web server (as in the case of Internet-visible phones), then he can make the phone start any VoIP calls WITHOUT a password. This is because the CGI script that handles such POST requests is publicly available (can be talked to, without a password).\r\n\r\nQuoted from .mario's post, some possible attacks include:\r\n\r\n\"monitoring the victim by making a phone call to the attackerâ€™s number, who in tern will accept the call and recording the incoming sound. Note that the phone doesnâ€™t give any noticeable feedback (ring tones, etc) while the victim was kept under surveillance. Keep in mind that the victim pays for the call.\"\r\n\r\nIf I were you I would restrict access to such phones from the LAN only *immediately*."

I was looking for a phone on our LAN and (stupid) decided to do a quick port scan for it.\n\nnmap 5.0 running service scan (-sV) option against a snom phone may cause the phone to reboot. I can do this on snom v7.1.33 and 7.1.39. Foudn it out this afternoon so i'm still raising a ticket with Snom. \n\ni've run earlier versions of nmap previously and it doesn't cause this kind of error. highly amusing to know i can jump on someone's LAN and cause all their phones to reboot."
