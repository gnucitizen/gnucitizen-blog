    "content": "The reason for adding a comment to the post is that today January 22 2007, I examined the \"add new user\" request of both, Blogger Classic and New Blogger and I was impressed that Google had added tokens for both versions of Blogger.\r\n\r\nAt first, when I informed Google and forwarded the research, they simply replied with automated emails, finally pointing me to a Blogger help URL.\r\n\r\nSo I thought they didn't care much about CSRF issues. However, I must admit that I'm very impressed with them since they fixed the problem very fast.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to get additional ideas from some of you guys if possible.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the fixed \"add new user\" requests for both versions of Blogger (notice 'securityToken'):\r\n\r\n<pre><code>POST /add-authors.do HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www2.blogger.com\r\n\r\nblogID=12345678&amp;securityToken=fmA1trWgTvwf6XZIlyn9WI_n0Nc%3D%3A1169507915539&amp;authorsList=%3Cattacker%40domain.com%3E%2C+&amp;submit=true</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre><code>POST /add-authors.do HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www&#46;blogger.com\r\n\r\nblogID=12345678&amp;securityToken=fmA1trWgTvwf6XZIlyn9WI_n0Nc%3D%3A1169507915539&amp;authorsList=%3Cattacker%40domain.com%3E%2C+&amp;submit=true</code></pre>\r\n\r\nP.S.: I forgot to say thank you to Jeremiah Grossman who kindly gave me feedback on this research."
