There was a way to circumvent the <strong>allowscriptaccess</strong> tag using <strong>\\n</strong> to seperate the word javascript, but i believe that was also addressed in the flash 9 release, just wondering if i've missed something or my assumption here is right? Could you let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    "content": "Frank, this is not really an exploit but a walkthrough how to backdoor flash movies. Depending on what attributes you are using in the object tag that contains the flash movie you get different results. It is that simple. The purpose of this article is show that flash movies can be trivially backdoored with freely available command line tools.\r\n\r\nYour assumptions are right!"
