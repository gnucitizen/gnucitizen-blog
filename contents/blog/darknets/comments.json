While honeypots try to look interesting in order to attract the attacker's attention, darknets are mostly sitting passively waiting for someone to come in. They are not designed to look interesting but the simple fact that someone is sending packets to them is very, very, intriguing and suspicious."

When there's incoming traffic, it's often bots/worms/etc scanning my IP range (it's easy to know what it is depending on the packets or the port utilized... Google helps a lot here!)"
