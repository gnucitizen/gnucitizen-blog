I have a video for you, which demonstrates an iPhone exploit in action. Keep in mind that this is just one of the many exploits that have been discovered lately.

Once again, the problem is within the browser. Again? Well, browsers are quite complex piece of software. They usually work with loads of strings, due to JavaScript, and in general it is easy to screw up regardless of vendors efforts.

_I don't want to say that we are doomed but given that most mobile devices will soon have enhanced browsers, it is very likely that we will stumble across similar exploits in the future._
