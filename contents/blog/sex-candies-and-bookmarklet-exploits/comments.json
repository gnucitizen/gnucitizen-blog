Now, I am not completely sure whether the ported exploits work because I haven't personally invested time to check that, but I will as soon as I get some other stuff out of my way.\n\nI know that it sounds a bit like... <q>hei guys my stuff work and they are awesome. check them out.</q>... sort of showing off, but, that was not my intention, indeed, there are some exploits ported and for sure they will get on this website as soon as the framework is completed."
