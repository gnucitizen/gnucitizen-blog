The Black Hat Europe 2008 event took place on the 27th and 28th of March. In this post, you will be able to find information regarding my talk and research. My presentation was titled [Client-side Security](http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-europe-08/bh-eu-08-speakers.html#Petkov). Here is the abstract:

> Client-side software generally refers to a class of computer programs that are executed on the client, by the user's supporting environment, instead of the server. Both clients and servers are in constant interaction. In a Web environment, the client is represented by the user's web browser, while the server is the remote computer which serves dynamic content. In a much broader context, the client-server relationships can be represented by a network client connected to a WiFi network.
> 
> This paper[/presentation] describes numerous techniques for attacking Clients-side technologies. The content of the paper is based the research that has been conducted over the past year by the GNUCITIZEN Ethical Hacker Outfit.

The event was very interesting and very well organized. I met a lot of people and had very interesting discussions all together. You can download the conference materials from [here](/files/2008/04/pdp-gnucitizen.zip). The paper is located [here](/files/2008/04/client-side-security-one-year-later.pdf) and the slides over [here](/files/2008/04/client-side-security-slides-bh.pdf).
