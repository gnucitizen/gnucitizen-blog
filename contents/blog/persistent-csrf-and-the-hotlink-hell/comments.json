    "content": "Nice idea! There is also a nice side-effect that you didn't mention. Conventional CSRF will leave traces in the logs because it will send Referer headers showing to the site the attack originated from. But if somebody is hotlinking to you and you make an HTTP redirect the Referer header will only show the site that contains the image, not the actual attacker. There are a few forums that annoy me by hotlinking to my images, maybe I should start being evil ;)"

An application vulnerable to CSRF is vulnerable regardless of the vector. The way in which the request is triggered to the vulnerable application has nothing to do being more or less vulnerable for persistent or non persistent.\n\nRegarding the RSS vector this was also discussed in my blackhat talk and whitepaper as a great CSRF vector. \n\nPaper: http://www.cgisecurity.com/papers/HackingFeeds.pdf\nBlackhat Slides: http://www.cgisecurity.com/papers/RSS-Security.ppt"

So, this page:\n\n<pre><code>bob.com/action.php?logout</code></pre>\n\nWould be replaced with this page:\n\n<pre><code>bob.com/action.php?trylogout</code></pre>\n\nWhich dynamically creates a new link to actually logout:\n\n<pre><code>bob.com/action.php?trylogout&amp;token=randomjunk</code></pre>\n\nIf there's no <code>token=randomjunk</code>, trylogout flops.\n\nIf I understand this attack correctly (I'm fairly new at web application security), then the intermediary page prevents the attack.

This is NO different than if I embedded an img tag into a website. I'm not taking advantage of a persistent CSRF vuln in the site, I'm making the vector in which I launch the CSRF vuln persistent. One of the reasons I've chimed in is that the statement is inaccurate."

Think about it, the attacker does not need to social engineer the user every time the need to do something. The attack will happen on its own.\n\nUsually persistent XSS is rated as medium to high risk. The same thing should apply to persistent CSRF imho."

    "content": "Hi PDP.  This is an interesting topic that has been on my mind lately.  I agree with the other commenter that 'Persistent CSRF' is a meaningless pharse.  We are arguing semantics here, but this is what I am thinking.\r\n\r\nAn application is 'vulnerable' to CSRF by just working in a browser.  This is simply a fact of life of the architecture of HTTP and browsers.  Cookies will be sent by the browser when it makes requests.  Period.  Maybe the browser tries to limit the requests it makes, but when it makes them, if it has cookies, they will be sent.  There is nothing an application can do to prevent this.\r\n\r\nAn application may have serious CSRF vulnerabilities if it allows for any type of state change to happen without taking some kind of precautions - like including a nonce, captcha, or some other device designed to make sure that the legitamate user actually is the one initiating these requests.\r\n\r\nWhat you describe is a persistent vector for CSRF.  Just because I can send your browser to a URL, does not mean that the URL will do anything.   It is independent of the actual CSRF problem that will be exploited.  \r\n\r\nIn persistent XSS, if you fix the problem by using proper input validation or output encoding, then you have fixed the problem.  With persistent CSRF (as you call it), both the vector (the image src that is under an attackers control) and the actual CSRF vuln (the request that gets submitted) need to be fixed independently.\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing is that the commercial web application scanners have recently started looking for places where they can control the source of an image tag, and they call any such situation \"CSRF\".  I disagree, for the reasons stated above.  It is simply a vector through which CSRF -may- be exploited.  By itself, however, it is not a CSRF vulnerability.  It is a 'force the user's browser to do a GET' vulnerability.  They are not the same thing."
