I need to do a lot of clean up work around all my projects. So, expect a series of quick posts. In this post you will be able to find my [slides](/files/2008/06/risk2008-oslo-slides.pdf) from a quite cool [event in Oslo](http://www.mnemonic.no/features/risk-2008-2/view?set_language=en). The topic is Web2.0 again. The event was quite successful and I am looking forward to attending it again. Not to mention that Oslo was just brilliant compared to the bad weather in UK.
