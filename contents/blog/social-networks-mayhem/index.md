Recently I stumbled upon the following video. It is nothing but an example of what we, as security professionals, are up against. You see, web application security nearly affects everybody.

This video does not really show the security aspects of social networks but it does a pretty good job of showing, in a very dramatic way, how social networks could affect your life, your social life if you like. All these social networks can be fun but be very careful with what you do online because you may unknowingly give sensitive information that can be used for all sorts of things against you, like for example identity theft.
