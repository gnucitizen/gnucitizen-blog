Back in the days when Google Hacking was the hot topic of the day, I wrote a simple python script for scraping results from the google's search pages. Unlike other google search scripts, my script did not rely on any APIs. So, you may find it useful. Moreover, we are actually going to refer to this script in the upcoming days as we have some very interesting stuff to talk about here at GNUCITIZEN.

Use the script responsibly and keep in mind Google's Terms of Service before doing anything drastic. The command line interface is configured to run through up to 5 pages. You can change that at source level or if you embed it into your own scripts.

_Let me know if you have any problems. The script is self documented and quite simple, so you should not have any problems getting used to it._
