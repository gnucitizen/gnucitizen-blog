The picture that you see is a work of art produced by the British street artist Banksy. Underneath, you will find a great summary on common Web Application security threats put together by [Joe Walker](http://getahead.org/blog/joe/) for the "[The Ajax Experience](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/)" event, which took place last week in Boston. It is highly recommended to check it out although you might be familiar with the content.

_I would like to say just one thing: "Great work Joe. I haven't seen any presentation that puts it out in such a clear way."_
