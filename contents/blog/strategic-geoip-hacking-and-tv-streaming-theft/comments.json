    "content": "My personal experience has been that scanrand is indeed fast, but also misses quite some open ports.\n\nYes, nmap _will_ run very slow with the provided command line. But you can speed it up quite a bit. First, scanning with -P0 is dead slow, because nmap has no round-trip-time information without a ping first, and will default to a slow scan mode. Second, nmap has a not-so-well documented fast single port scan mode. Third, you can speed things up by setting less conservative timing limits\n\nAn updated nmap command line would be: <code>nmap -PS5001 -S5 -n -iL targets -p5001 -oG results</code>"
