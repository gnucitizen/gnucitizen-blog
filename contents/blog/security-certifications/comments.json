    "content": "I did a write-up of the various infosec certs here: http://dmiessler.com/writing/infoseccerts/\r\n\r\nMy thoughts are that certs show very little knowledge on the part of the candidate. They're little more than HR tools. Here's the bottom-line:\r\n\r\n\"The value of a certification is exactly the value that others place on it--no more, no less. If you're interested in the actual value of a given cert, check the job sites, call your recruiter friends, and talk to hiring managers. Just as with currency exchange rates, the only way to determine \"true\" value is to see how much others are willing to pay for it.\""

As I mention with you and AP about my concept of Hack Fu years ago.. A technique is just a technique... Just another way in expressing it.... People who got lots of professional certifications only shows they are good at memorizing brain dumps and putting the same answers in exams. It is nothing more than showing they remember the Kata, form or Routines like in Karate and Kung Fu. But in really combats, Kata, form and Routines will not protect you from really combat or warfare ..... Where the bad guys will not follow the same rules......"

    "content": "Certification in IT is like an university degree - it shows that according to some organization you are supposed to have certain skills and have acquired certain knowledge in a field. It doesn't do anything more than that. Every self-respecting employer will test your skills regardless of how many degrees, certificates, recommendations etc. you have. And I think that this is right and this is the way to do it (until certificate organizations and universities reduce their scrap rate to zero). Such documents can help you to get through only the first round. After that, you are on your own. But having them for their own sake is stupid and useless."

    "content": "I generally agree, especially with regard to CISSP. I'm sure there are some excellent practitioners with the CISSP, but most that I have met have very little real-world understanding of technology.\r\n\r\nA possible exception is SANS in that the training is extremely beneficial even if you don't get the certification. With things like CISSP and CISA, you are training specifically to get the certification. With SANS (at least in my experience), you are training to actually improve your skills. If you pass the certification, at least I know you were tested over useful information and not the usage of buzzwords."

    "content": "In short, my view is that there is nothing like experience/skills. However, once you acquire the skills to exceed at your profession, it wouldn't hurt to get some certs. Why? Because some people believe in it.\r\n\r\nSometimes you gotta give people what they want. Just like when you wanna get an A on a test: you simply answer the questions the way the teacher wants, even if you don't agree with him/her. I say get the best of both worlds (certs+real skills), can't go wrong. but mostly, make sure you know your stuff so you can look at yourself in the mirror."

If a particular certification is going to get you an interview which may lead to a job you want, having it is a no brainer. Get the cert first - the experience will come when you have the job. If you already have the experience, you probably don't need the cert but it will still help you get noticed on a recruiter's search. \r\n\r\nSomeone mentioned University degrees here. Most of them aren't worth the paper they are written on, but if you're just starting out, try getting a job these days without one."

    "content": "param, I am sorry but I do not agree. Certifications provide false sense of knowledge to the employer. And I can assure you that there are people with no certifications who make the average security consultant yearly salary over two weeks.\r\n\r\nCertifications are designed for two reasons: control and false sense of equality. Again, it is a personal choice. In a similar way you can make a lot of money from the falling stock market right now but most people don't do it. It is a matter of personal choice and also lack of understandings about how things actually work.\r\n\r\nTo wrap up, certifications together with collage/university diplomas provide no assurance that the person who has them is employable or can provide any value whatsoever."

    "content": "pdp, somehow i understand what you are saying about security certificates. But i believe that if you combine security certificate and work experience with good reputation, then you are kind a clear water. In any way if some one is going to hire (senior) security officer he/she will be examine candidate background and etc. No one should hire people just because he/she holds some certificate, you have to have some other information that support information which you get from candidate. So in that light i think security certificate are good."

You will have a name one day.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, they are just a paper to prove that you are able to do something when nobody knows you. But everybody know that, some people donÂ´t need certifications to know somethings and be a good professional."

    "content": "Certifications are useless as a claim to fame that one is \"the best\" or \"the elite\" in the infosec industry. A lot of CISSPs and CISMs out there are merely infosec linguists... they can't even printf \"Hello World\" even if there was a gun pointed at their head, much less even tell the difference between a CX and BX 8086 register --the point being that a pentest or similar risk assessment program may have a highly inaccurate \"expert\" understanding, that will result with a misguided professional opinion about the real risks an organization is exposed to, if the certified infosec professional is just a philologist (one who can talk the \"talk\" but can't walk the \"walk\"). \r\n\r\nHowever, for us in SE Asia, certifications can mean having contracts, or be a starving pentester (I know this only too well). Certs are a great marketing tool --and they can help get you through the first door. And that's all you need really, just to be given the one chance to prove yourself worthy with your electronic ninjutsu. Once you've done that, and have gone on to become a 10th-dan cyber ninja, only can people see you as out of that \"box around yourself\"."
