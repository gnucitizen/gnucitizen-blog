MySpace is considered by far the largest social network today. These videos outlines the history of MySpace with facts and dates. I hope that you understand the importance of MySpace as one of the building blocks of future technologies. Of course, there is a price to pay. Social networks do not only give technological advantage to the people/corporations who sit behind them, but they also provide criminals with established and easily accessible infrastructure for doing mischief.
