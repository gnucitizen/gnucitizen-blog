Very often I end up performing a series of string manipulation and information extraction tasks from the command line. Usually this is achieved with several excellent shell utilities available on Linux/Unix/Cygwin.

Because it is quite tedious to re-type long commands every single time, I composed a [collection of oneliner](http://code.google.com/p/infocrobes/)s (scripts) that are very easy to use and cat extract all kinds of useful informations from arbitrary data streams. The toolkit was designed around the idea of using pipes.

**UPDATE 2011/04/20**: This project has not been maintained for the last couple of years although it should work more or less. Feel free to reach us if you want to take the lead.
