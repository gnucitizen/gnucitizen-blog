It feels nice to be back home. Needless to say, I had a lot of fun at [OWASP USA 2007 event](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/7th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_San_Jose_2007/Agenda), which took place in San Jose, CA in ebay's main campus. If you were not there you simply missed it. There were some great talks, which worth everyone's attention. No to mention that they were plain interesting and fun just in general.

I was honored to present my [research on Web2.0 hacking](/blog/for-my-next-trick-hacking-web20), which I've also talked about over [here](/blog/owasp-day-2007). The slides were slightly adjusted to suit the allocated time frame for my talk (1h), which I managed to perfectly fit into (11:20 to 12:20).

_Check the referenced links for more information and also the previous slides._
