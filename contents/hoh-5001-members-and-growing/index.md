I have good news. The [HoH](http://www.houseofhackers.org) community has grown to 5001 members since its launch 3 months ago. I find this very interesting for a relatively small and fun social experiment to turn so big.

I would like to thank all members for creating one of the most colorful, extraordinary, exciting, provocative, intelligent, intense, creative... community out there. I've said that this is a community effort and sure it is.

We have long way ahead of us. It is a journey not a destination and we have some great ideas too materialize. Thanks to all of you, one more time.
