[RDF (Resource Description Framework)](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) is one of the first initiatives from [W3C](http://www.w3.org) to give meaning to the WEB. I've spent quite a lot of time researching on this technology and the more I am looking at it, the more I realise how powerful it could be when applied to the computer security field. You see, RDF is designed to enable better information aggregation, more generic information analysis and more meaningful information storage. In its basics RDF allows various types of information to be plugged in various ways, into any context and than to be easily extracted without knowing the underlying dependencies.

How this could be? Most of us know how databases look like: tables, columns, rows and primary keys. This is nice. The better you design your database the longer it will serve its purpose. In the RDF world, design doesn't matter. As long as the information is there it can be extracted and processed. This is a powerful concept that requires some serious thinking.

I highly recommend to have a look at RDF. It will help you with understanding database technologies better. RDF takes a bit of effort to learn but this skill can be applied to many situations quite effectively.
