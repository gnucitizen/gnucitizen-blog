I [covered](/blog/google-search-api-worms) Google AJAX Search API functionalities a week ago. I also provided my view why this service is practically dangerous and how it can be used by AJAX/JavaScript based worms to propagate. It seams that the situations have become a lot more interesting since Google released a full blown AJAX Search Service called [SearchMash](http://www.searchmash.com/).

I am not planning to go into details again why and how SearchMash can be used for malicious purposes. Anyone who is interested in this subject can preview my previous article [here](/blog/google-search-api-worms). The extensive comment log is also quite interesting.

_I am planning to implement some of the SearchMash features into [AttackAPI](/blog/attackapi) [GoogleSearch module](/blog/attackapi/build/inf/interfaces/GoogleSearch.htm) in the 0.9 release. I really like what the Google guys are doing but at the same time I can clearly see the dangerous side of their work._
