XSSDB provides an intelligent way for browsing and learning about different [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSS) attack vectors. The database itself is built upon [RSnake's Cross-site Scripting Cheat Sheet](http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html) which is one of the most accurate resources for Cross-site Scripting attacks up to date.

> The GNUCITIZEN team members realize that it is a burden to fully maintain the XSS database ourselves. We believe that this task can be managed via our open platform with a little bit of help from the security community.

Currently, XSSDB allows you to browse through the original database. Soon you will be able to maintain the attack database yourself. If you have a proposal, question, suggestion or correction, please contact us.

**UPDATE 09/05/2011**: This project is pretty much dead. Let us know if you want to revive it.
