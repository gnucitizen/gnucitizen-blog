We've got some audio from the past Black Hat conference I've already talked about over [here](/blog/my-bh-las-vegas-slides/) and [here](/blog/my-black-hat-talk/).

Keep in mind that without the [slides](/blog/my-bh-las-vegas-slides/) it will probably sound very boring. Both parts of the presentation can be found [here](http://www.gnucitizen.org/static/blog/2008/09/pdpblackhatusa2008-part1.wma) and [here](http://www.gnucitizen.org/static/blog/2008/09/pdpblackhatusa2008-part2.wma).
