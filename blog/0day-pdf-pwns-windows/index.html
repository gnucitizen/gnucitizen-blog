<p>I am closing the season with the following <strong>HIGH</strong> Risk vulnerability: Adobe Acrobat/Reader PDF documents can be used to compromise your Windows box. Completely!!! Invisibly and unwillingly!!! All it takes is to open a PDF document or stumble across a page which embeds one.</p>

<p>The issue is quite <strong>critical</strong> given the fact that PDF documents are in the core of today&#39;s modern business. This and the fact that it may take a while for Adobe to fix their closed source product, are the reasons why I am not going to publish any POCs. You have to take my word for it. The POCs will be released when an update is available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adobe&#39;s representatives can contact me from the usual <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/contact">place</a>. My advise for you is not to open any PDF files (locally or remotely). Other PDF viewers might be vulnerable too. The issues was verified on Windows XP SP2 with the latest Adobe Reader 8.1, although previous versions are also affected.</p>

My result with the Greymagic POC on Windows 2000 was that the asp file, downloaded and opened locally, would start calc.exe when opened with IE but not when opened with Seamonkey. This is with Active X totally turned off in 4 IE zones but probably still on in the 5th zone which I have not made visible. (Note, i do not use browser plugins and do not have Adobe installed, so it was clearly the Active X.)

pdp, will you at least say whether what you've found is the same as or different than the greymagic POC? This would help with user protection.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/729f89d432ded2a638b6c897f20b2076?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="swhx7"><span class="post-comment-author">swhx7</span><div class="post-comment-content">Apologies, I see my question was already answered in the reply to Thor.

I'm interpreting "interaction" in Foxit as something more than just opening a PDF. If this is correct, then Foxit can be a safe alternative for now if used with care.

The interaction referred to could be either something with Javascript or clicking a link (any other possibilities? form?). In my version of Foxit, at least up to v.2 I think, Javascript is an optional add-on, not installed by default.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/253abced36f672589af48bad405580a2?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Somewhat_Concerned"><span class="post-comment-author">Somewhat_Concerned</span><div class="post-comment-content">Does the exploit look for a local file path, a remote file path, or both?

Does your exploit allow for arbitrary command line arguments? If so, could you post a PoC loading c:\boot.ini in notepad.exe to prove it?

Waiting for detailed information about it.

You said it works in Acrobat (as shown in video) and in browser. What difference and can you make video (in browser demonstration)? And what browsers are vulnerable (and what Acrobat/Reader/plugin versions except Adobe Reader 8.1).

About video: it is harmless one, but you can make harmful video :-). To show all possibility of this hole and to make people (and Adobe guys) to be more aware of danger of this vulnerability. You can make "format c:" demonstration ;-). Make it in VM environment (it will be harmless and easier for you and will be bright demonstration of the hole).</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/3c41ba676251eb6ab8d0727fd5313947?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="MadScientist"><span class="post-comment-author">MadScientist</span><div class="post-comment-content">Any update from Adobe on a patch?

Is The fix out already ? 

It's funny, but before I read about this PDF vulnerability, a while back, I was thinking is that possible ?  maybe I was just being creatively thinking lol as no one really expect a "text file" be a vehicle for madness !

Microsoft has no other choice but to patch up the issue just to satisfy the community, even though this may not by entirely their problem. First of all developers should not really trust the user input and pass it to a function that they don't fully understand. Now, some of you may criticize me for this statement, but do we blame PHP or ASP for the SQL Injections that your software has? No! Why should anyone pass something that does not look like a URL into a function that expects URLs?</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/4d59140c495fbcbc36fdc8bbffd0462b?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="thorin"><span class="post-comment-author">thorin</span><div class="post-comment-content">Thanks pdp that technet blog article was great.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/1265deee50c8070f2203eefe89d67f58?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Adrian"><span class="post-comment-author">Adrian</span><div class="post-comment-content">Thanks. 

For those who are against the idea of publishing this vulnerability. Their concerns are understood. People just don't like being helpless. To make an analogy, I would imagine that we shouldn't talk about AIDS because we didn't find a cure for it; we shouldn't broadcast news of Burma because we can't help the people there.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/3c41ba676251eb6ab8d0727fd5313947?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="MadScientist"><span class="post-comment-author">MadScientist</span><div class="post-comment-content">Adrian: not the best analogy since AIDS is rampant in the wild and many people are working on stopping it, so we need to talk about it. With the PDF vulnerability, it is still contained.

I'm a big fan of full disclosure *if the vendor is unresponsive* as a means to increase pressure for a solution. If I can find a vulnearbility, so can many others, so we need a fix. But if the vendor has acknowledged and is working towards a 'cure', give them time before unleashing the madness.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/ec3f2d09d20ac2e0415d9f37302d195d?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Picco"><span class="post-comment-author">Picco</span><div class="post-comment-content">Why can't we have an example of this vurnerability ?</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c857a3381eab0e4397956df67b5c0d06?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="cyanid-E"><span class="post-comment-author">cyanid-E</span><div class="post-comment-content">hi

I opened your pdf on a linux system
via:

1. adobe firefox plugin
2. adobe reader 8.1.1 ("Adobe strongly recommends upgrading to Adobe Reader 8.1.1")

and evolution offered me to send an email to guys with really strange email adresses:

1. "windows/system32/calc.exe"
