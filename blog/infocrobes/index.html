<p>Because it is quite tedious to re-type long commands every single time, I composed a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/infocrobes/">collection of oneliners</a> (scripts) that are very easy to use and cat extract all kinds of useful informations from arbitrary data streams. The toolkit was designed around the idea of using pipes.</p>
