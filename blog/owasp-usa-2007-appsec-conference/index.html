<p>I was honored to present my <a href="/blog/for-my-next-trick-hacking-web20">research on Web2.0 hacking</a>, which I&#39;ve also talked about over <a href="/blog/owasp-day-2007">here</a>. The slides were slightly adjusted to suit the allocated time frame for my talk (1h), which I managed to perfectly fit into (11:20 to 12:20).</p>
