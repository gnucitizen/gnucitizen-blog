<p>There were many interesting presentations. We&#39;ve tried to attend all of them although it was really hard to do so when the weather in Krakow was so nice (very different from the weather in cloudy/rainy London). As usual, Adrian and I presented our &quot;Cracking into Embedded Devices&quot; and &quot;Client-side Security&quot; talks. However, Adrian had some human vulnerabilities in his slides. All of them were zero-days. I suggest to check them out. I had no human vulnerabilities but I showed the video of the QuickTime exploit for Vista and XP so I guess we are even technically-wise, although I prefer the human exploits to be honest.</p>
<p>Anyway, the client-side security slides can be downloaded from <a href="/files/2008/05/client-side-security-slides-confidence2008.pdf">here</a>. The embedded devices cracking slides can be downloaded from <a href="/files/2008/05/cracking-into-embedded-devices-confidence-2k8.pdf">here</a>. And of course, if you want to see some of the pictures from the event, you can visit <a href="http://www.houseofhackers.org">House of Hackers</a> and check the <a href="http://www.houseofhackers.org/photo/album/show?id=2092781:Album:36981">CONFidence 2008 album</a>. I am sure that everybody enjoyed the event as much as we did.</p>
