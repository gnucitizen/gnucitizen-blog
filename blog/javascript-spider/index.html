<p><a href="/files/2006/10/spider.htm">The JavaScript Spider</a> is the first implementation of a proof of concept tool which shows that Javascript can be in fact quite malicious. This implementation depends on <a href="http://proxydrop.com">proxydrop.com</a> but other proxies can be used too: <a href="http://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a> is one of them. Keep in mind that the tool spiders only one page.</p>
<p>As you can see, publicly available anonymizing proxies can be used to fetch remote pages. This technique will work quite successfully on Internet resources but not on Intranet. The reason for this is obvious.</p>
<p><em>The requests made are anonymous since they are proxied. This may amplify or reduce the risk depending on the situation. However an anonymous self-propagating worm can be in theory - <strong>possible</strong>.</em></p>

Using a publicly-accessible anonymous proxy is hardly a security concern - especially considering that none of the user's personal information is passed along.

Honestly, the only thing that you "discovered" (and that was just something you noticed, as the world has passed you by) is that publicly-accessible anonymous proxies can be used for "bad" things.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">Hi John, I appreciate your comment but from what I can see from your blog, you are not a dealing with security at all. That is the reason why I believe that you are more experienced in JavaScript programming than me and I am more experienced in security than you.

As far as what attack vector is... well, I am not claiming that my English is perfect but if we <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:vector" rel="nofollow">google</a> for the word vector you will see that there are mainly two types of definitions: one related to biology and one related to mathematics. Check these two samples:

<blockquote>carrier of an infectious agent; capable of transmitting infection from one host to another; especially the animal that transfers an infectious agent from one host to another, usually an arthropod. <strong>life.umd.edu</strong></blockquote>

<blockquote>A vector is a number (a magnitude) together with a direction (compare with scalar). A vector can be represented by an arrow whose length represents the magnitude and the direction represents the direction. <strong>enchantedlearning.com</strong></blockquote>

It is more than obvious what attack vector is.

You are also saying:

<blockquote>Honestly, the only thing that you 'discovered' (and that was just something you noticed, as the world has passed you by) is that publicly-accessible anonymous proxies can be used for "bad" things.</blockquote>

You are right for one thing. Publicly accessible proxies can be used for bad things and that's nothing new. However, who has done it in the past with JavaScript? I couldn't find anything like this on the web and to me it is a new thing.

John, I am very interested to see your opinion on this respond. Many thanks.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">Hi Anush,

What do you expect? What I am trying to do can be appreciated by those who understand the subject.

However, I think that the community will be quite interested in your solution if you manage to do what I am trying to do without using the technique I have already discussed. :)

I am not overconfident. Do I sound overconfident? I am sorry if this is the impression you are getting.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/803e289068dc08d5b34ae47778e67bb6?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="maluc"><span class="post-comment-author">maluc</span><div class="post-comment-content">Wow .. such hatred.

John, you apparently didn't understand the post at all. He's not claiming that those using proxies are at greater risk, or that their personal information can be disclosed by it. It has nothing to do with proxy users.

It's saying that by using certain public proxies you can work around the javascript's same origin policies. If you bothered reading his previous blog posts about Google Search API Worms, you'd understand. Another tool in the arsenal, alongside google and yahoo's APIs

This may help you comprehend the security restrictions of javascript: http://www.windowsitlibrary.com/Content/1160/22/1.html

For some reason Proxydrop.com filters out all javascript. You should take another proxy.
