<p>There is no merit in discussing how this has been done and for what purposes but this incident is yet another proof that the attack landscape is rapidly changing and moving towards web enabled infrastructures and the client-side. Soon or later almost every website will be equipped with social capabilities (google&#39;s own opensocial and friendconnect platforms) and than simple persistent XSS attacks will turn into quite nasty problems.</p>
<p>Time will tell!</p>
