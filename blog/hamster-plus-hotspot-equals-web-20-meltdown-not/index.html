<p>I have nothing against <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/">Robert</a>, he is a good guy, but I have to say that his research has nothing to do with Web2.0. Man-in-the-middle attacks have been known for ages and being able to sniff the session identifier from a HTTP connection over unprotected/unencrypted channel is not new. Of course it works. I mean, of course it works. And yes, do not use Telnet because someone will be able to capture your credentials. Of course it works! It is unencrypted channel, therefore it means that everyone will be able to see the traffic.</p>
<p>Cookies are standard mechanism to imitate statefulness for otherwise stateless HTTP connections. If someone sniffs them from the air they will be able to impersonate the connection they support. This is it! Finito! And, btw, you don&#39;t need any special tools to do all that. All you need is bash with some very basic utils you can find on any standard Unix/Linux distribution. Here is an <a href="https://chatbotkit.com/examples">example</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Kismet</li>
<li>Read the Kismet dump file</li>
<li>Extract Strings</li>
<li>Match and extract cookies</li>
</ol>
<p>i.e:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; kismet&amp;
&gt; tail -f kismet.dump | string | grep -iE &#39;Set-cookie:|Cookie:&#39;</code></pre><p>Here you go! So, I don&#39;t really understand what is the fuss all about. Again, I repeat, this is not Web2.0 problem and I repeat this is not Web2.0 problem and I repeat.</p>

<blockquote>Web 8.0 Mashup Hacking with Yahoo Tubes. WTF?</blockquote>

well, yes. Yahoo Pipes is a Web2.0 technology so I don't see any problems with using Web2.0 terminology. Moreover, the pipes interface proves one thing: I can spider Web Applications in search for vulnerabilities circumventing to an extend the same origin policies. That wasn't possible before. There is more to that but you will hear about it soon. So yes, it is new and yes it is Web2.0. So, what exactly is your point, Galeazzi?

The technical stuff are still on the blog but I have to agree with you that there was sort of a dry period lately. The reason for this is mainly because I was involved into two huge projects, the XSS Book and the Google Hacking for Penteasters vol2 book. However, there is a lot in the background going on that you cannot see. :) So, stay tuned.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">Daniel, you are completely right <q>everything new is well forgotten old thing</q>.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/80d7b8935b953dabd63268177b7981f6?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Ronald"><span class="post-comment-author">Ronald</span><div class="post-comment-content">Hehe pretty funny, although everyone knows that wireless connections are insecure from day one.

That some webmail providers don't support it isn't worthy of a BlackHat talk.  If anything, all this shows is that BlackHat needs some better people to review submissions.  However, I do agree with the above poster that you are also guilty of publishing the same old thing again and again, pdp.

Your JavaScript Spider is just another take on Jikto which was just another take on your own earlier research.  Any service which will "launder" http requests for you enables partial violation of same origin.  Big deal.  The fact that new services (pipes, etc) are now out there that make it easier isn't anything new - much like sniffing cookies over wifi isn't new.  So while I agree that perhaps "Web2.0" is a misnomer for Graham's work, you have also been rehashing the same old thing for quite some time.

Yahoo Pipes will now send a post for you! So, who really cares?  Anyone can create a similar service with a very cheap webhost account.  You could probably do it with netcat and bash.  It does not equate to "MAGE POWERFUL".</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">rezn, first of all "MAGE POWERFUL" was a play of words which obviously didn't succeeded to get the message out the way I had pictured in my head.

Anyway, I see what you are saying. I completely agree with you that the JavaScript spider was rehashed version of Jikto and yes Jikto is pretty much the proxy POC I published last year but this is not what my talk and the work on GNUCITIZEN is all about. It is about agents. It is about autonomous robots that live on the surface of the web.

Let's face it, what's the point of discovering vulnerabilities on the fly? I mean what's the point of having XSS scanner written in JavaScript? It makes no difference at all. It is slow, sloppy and highly ineffective. So why?

Let's forget about it. If you combine several key components of the so called Web2.0 we can really come up with something nasty and something probably worth our attention. This thing will be based primary on services which we cannot easily shutdown and will have recovery processes to ensure preservation. And the POCs (the JavaScript spider and XSS scanner) are just demonstration of certain features that possibly will be included to one degree or another. What if I tell you that JavaScript can receive as well send emails. It starts to get interesting, right? What if the attacker have several agents spread across the web which he/she can control via distributed broadcast messages. Now we completely change the game. Where is the head of the worm? There isn't any. How do I stop this? You can't!

I hope that with my next presentation it will get a lot clearer what I mean. I am sure that I can convince you in what I believe and show you the value of the research if we talk in person. However, the truth is that we have to deal with virtual boundaries and it is completely my fault for not having the message out as clear as possible today.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/ef14ae4ef69235fa6c3709438357819d?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pagvac"><span class="post-comment-author">pagvac</span><div class="post-comment-content">Nothing to do with WEB 2.0. This is just a design problem with most web apps that use login form authentication (99% of webapps).  Even if SSL is supported during authentication, the connection downgrades to clear-text HTTP for overhead reasons right after submitting your username and password.

However, this attack remains one of my favorites against hotspots. It's easy, passive and works like a charm.

As long as Robert doesn't claim is new or WEB 2.0 related, I don't see a problem with this research.

My wife was amazed when I tested this against her gmail account. This means that although most people in the security community know about this attack, most average users don't. And remember, there is NO idle session time out on Gmail. And who clicks on logout? Only geeks do :D</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2025 <a href=""></a>.
