<p>Let&#39;s pick the keywords from the text presented above. Spam, blogs, promoting, PageRank, text stolen and high number of links. Right, keep that for a moment!</p>
<p>Creating a spam blog is easy. Find as many RSS feeds as possible. Put them into some kind of RSS consumer written in whatever language you prefer. Upload the consumed posts into blogs that you control. Enjoy your empire. Soon, you will receive hits from everywhere, especially from <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>. Then other splogers will duplicate your feeds. You may also generate some profit by putting some ads from Google... But what if you are malicious? Instead of ads you can control a small army of soldiers ready to serve upon your command. You think it is impossible? What if I tell you that splogs can go far beyond what most vicious worms have achieved? Rapid propagation!!! I think so!</p>
<p>Using the techniques such as <a href="/blog/persistent-bi-directional-communication-channels">persistent channels</a>, <a href="/blog/backdooring-mp3-files">backdoors in QuickTime</a>, <a href="/blog/backdooring-flash-objects-receipt">backdoors in Flash</a>, <a href="http://michaeldaw.org/md-hacks/backdooring-pdf-files/">backdoors in PDF</a>, <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11424">backdoors in RealMedia</a> and <a href="/blog/cross-context-scripting-with-sage">backdoors in RSS feeds</a> in conjunction with splogs one can achieve quite a lot. Moreover, I know that the process can be automated. Every flash file the sploger downloads can be altered; every sound, backdoored; every image, changed. It is not a war between the humans and the machines. It is a war between us and ourselves only.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get back to the keywords from the beginning of this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spam</strong> - a lot of content</li>
<li><strong>blogs</strong> - web2.0, everybody loves them</li>
<li><strong>promoting</strong> - a lot of users</li>
<li><strong>PageRank</strong> - better PageRank, even more users</li>
<li><strong>text stolen</strong> - phish better</li>
<li><strong>high number of links</strong> - persistance</li>
</ul>
<p><em>So, where does this leave us? Well, to be honest with you, we are in a big <code>$**</code>. Forget about your firewall and fancy antivirus and welcome the <strong>Wild Wild West 2.0</strong></em></p>

I can help you with this problem . I know a lot of spammers and I will ask them not to post on your site. It will reduce the volume of spam by 30-50% .In return Id like to ask you to put a link to my site on the index page of your site. The link will be small and your visitors will hardly notice it , its just done for higher rankings in search engines.
