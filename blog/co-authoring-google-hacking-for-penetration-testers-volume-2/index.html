<p>For those who don&#39;t know what Google Hacking is or are still skeptical about it, here is what some people say about the first book. This information can be accessed from Syngress&#39;s website as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Understanding the adversary mindset is an important element in designing and developing effective protective strategies.&quot; - Amit Yoran, Former Director of the National Cyber Security Division, Department of Homeland Security</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...Google Hacking exposes those with their pants down, so the whole Internet can see their skivvies.&quot; - Adrian Lamo, Special Project Editor, The American River Current</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This Book Rocks!&quot; - Roelof Temmingh, Technical Director, SensePost (Creators of the Wikto Web Assessment Tool)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You can use Google for something other than hacking? I only use Google for finding vulnerable servers.&quot; - Tim Mullen, CIO, AnchorIS.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, I am still waiting for a box full of <a href="/blog/xss-attacks-cross-site-scripting-exploits-and-defence">XSS Attacks - Cross Site Scripting Exploits and Defence</a> books, which I am going to give away to the GNUCITIZEN readers. We&#39;ve got some great comments about this book too; check out the Amazon reviews over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cross-Site-Scripting-Attacks-Exploits/dp/1597491543/ref=sr_1_1/103-8131239-3320616?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1177490664&amp;sr=8-1">here</a>. So, some great stuff are coming up. A lot of work needs to be done, but at the end it will be all worthed. Stay tuned with the GNUCITIZEN <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/feed">rss channel</a> for more information.</p>
