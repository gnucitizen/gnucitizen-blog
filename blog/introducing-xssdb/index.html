<blockquote>
<p>RSnake, I didn&#39;t even know this attack vector was in your cheat sheet and I have been through it loads of times - A table of contents might be cool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the weekend I composed a <a href="/blog/xssdb">simple AJAX applications to provide a better way of previewing all attack vectors</a> from RSnake&#39;s Cross-site scripting cheat sheet. RSnake has been working on it for quite long time and I really like what he has done so far.</p>
<p>I am planning to extend the attack database with some of my own findings, keeping the original database updated and intact. I am also working on some features that will allow user submissions so the community is able to provide some feedback as well.</p>
<p><em>Any comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Currently XSSDB works in Firefox only. The application almost works in IE6 and IE7. There seams to be something wrong with Opera.</em></p>
