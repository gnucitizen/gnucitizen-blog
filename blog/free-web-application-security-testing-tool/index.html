You cannot rely 100% on the results they produce, without considering seriously their limitations. However, because these tools are so good at picking the low-hanging fruit by employing force and repetition, they still have a place in our arsenal of penetrating testing equipment.</p>
<p>These tools are not unfamiliar to modern day penetration testers. In fact, there are plenty of them to choose from, ranging from low-grade command line utilities to high-end frameworks. There are plenty of commercial tools as well some of which are a lot better, in terms of features and false-positives rate, when compared to open source alternatives. People often choose what they are more familiar with. I prefer to use tools that are right for the job without discriminating a particular operating system, platform, and style.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I would like to introduce to you yet another tool to compete in the market of automated web application security scanners (not only), released as part of our own <a href="http://www.websecurify.com">Websecurify</a> initiative. The tools is called Websecurify (big surprise) and it is written on the top of common web technologies, which provide significant benefit over other technologies used in open source and commercial alternative products.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key features of Websecurify:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is 100% open source, GPL, CC product, ready to benefit the open source movement</li>
<li>The engine employs technologies, such as Web Workers, from the latest HTML5 specs</li>
<li>Most of the code is written in JavaScript but many parts can be rewritten or extended with Python, Java and C</li>
<li>The core engine can be taken out from the binary bundles and used as part of self-defending web applications. I will talk about this soon.</li>
<li>The testing and reporting mechanisms are asynchronous. This means that the report is cooking while the test is performed. It also means that decisions are taken immediately, i.e. they are not scheduled.</li>
<li>The tool is cross-platformed thanks to xulrunner</li>
<li>Everything is written with extensibility in mind</li>
<li>It can be extended in pretty much the same way you can extend Firefox and Thunderbird</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many other features, which I am going to talk about soon.</p>
<p>At the moment the tool is only available as a MacOS DMG package and source code. The Windows and Linux versions will be released soon. In the future we are planning release all platform specific packages at the same time. Now is just an exception as we are mostly interested to get an early feedback. I am sure that that there will be a lot of bugs to fix and features to add/improve before we reach version 1.0. Version 0.2 can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.websecurify.com">www.websecurify.com</a> or our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/websecurify/">source code repository</a>.</p>

IMHO, technology-wise things are getting better although you see more and more hacking incidents happening. The biggest problems that face the Web and the Internet in general are mostly related to bad practices. In a system composed of humans and machines, the human is always the weakest link.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="kenrtx"><span class="post-comment-author">kenrtx</span><div class="post-comment-content">Woot!  Another web app tester, keep em comin.  Unfortunately I do not have my Mac anymore.  :(  

Email me once it's ready?  

No information on the product site, does it test signature libraries like the OWASP top 10 or is that something we'll have to add?  Tell us more.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">hi kenrtx, the windows and linux versions are coming along nicely. keep in mind that the we are only releasing version 0.2 which to be honest is not very advanced. however, we've got a solid framework which we can build on. saying that, websecurify pro is also coming along quite nicely and should be available for download soon.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Chris"><span class="post-comment-author">Chris</span><div class="post-comment-content">Terrific tool.
