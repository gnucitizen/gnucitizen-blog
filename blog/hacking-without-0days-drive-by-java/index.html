<p>For those of you who have never seen a warning message like the one bellow, this is the default dialog box you get from the Java Runtime when you run cryptographically signed applets. Signed applets are different in comparison to the unsigned ones. Basically they defer in terms of their security sandbox and level of privilege. Signed applets can do anything your desktop applications can do, although they run from within the browser.</p>
<div class="screen">[![](/files/2007/10/warning-supermario-3d-nintendo.jpg "Warning Supermario 3D Nintendo PNG")](/files/2007/10/warning-supermario-3d-nintendo.jpg)</div>

<p><em>The one million dollar question is:</em></p>
<h3 id="how-is-that-secure-and-should-sun-rethink-the-security-of-their-platform-">How is that secure? and Should Sun rethink the security of their platform?</h3>
<p>We know that unaware users will approve anything just to get their game running or job done for that matter. This type of attack is by far the simplest to pull and does not rely on any particular kind of vulnerability. The Java Runtime is the only browser embeddable object which gives such a degree of access from simple Web pages. Flash, Adobe Reader, and even Signed JavaScript (<strong>disabled by default</strong>) wont allow you to do all of these, mainly because it is highly insecure!</p>
<p>I know that a lot of angry Java developers and many &quot;military grade&quot; (I certainly not sure what military grade is) exploit hunters may object but let&#39;s be honest here for a moment. Most of the hacks occur due to simple human mistakes. In the case of the Java Runtime, there is <strong>50%</strong> chance to make the wrong choice. I think that malware authors and botnet operators like this figure a lot, especially when no vulnerability is required to perform the hack... not to mention that the information displayed inside the security warning box can be easily forged in such a way that the attackers can increase the their chances by making the user believe he or she is doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&#39;ve been using this type of attack in a number of scenarios and I am not extremely happy to say this (although I had may fare share of fun) but it works so well that it almost feels surreal. The attach tar file contains a tool which I wrote long time ago to compile and sign Applets and JAR files in a few simple steps. I use it every time I can, just to prove that having Java enabled on workstation part of a large enterprise is kind of a bad idea.</p>
<p><em>Cannot simply say that Java is insecure and we should avoid it at all cost. In fact, I think Java is awesome platform but it is obvious that although some of its security aspects are spot on, others are seriously lacking any thought.</em></p>

The answer of the $1M question - it is *very* secure from technical point of view since you can't harm the client's PC if he doesn't trust your applet. There is no technology which is protected from human mistakes ...</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">rado, very interesting but I have to disagree. It is not secure! Let's compare it with signed JavaScript which can do exactly the same as signed applets. The difference between both is that signed JavaScript is disabled by default (browser preferences) and there is no reason why you should have it enabled.

Moreover, compare this with tricking the user into downloading an executable and running it from the desktop: this thing requires more then one step and it looks very suspicious. Not to mention that if you have an anti-virus it is very likely that it will lock the executable if it matches a known signature and your Firewall wont probably let it go out. The chances for something like this to work is like <strong>10%</strong> maybe even less.

Let's compare it with browser extensions. The victim needs to first of all approve the supplier. Then wait for 3 seconds and then approve it. The first step requires 3 additional sub-steps, such as right clicking on the pop-up bar, selecting Approve suppler (whatever it was) option and clicking on the <strong>Allow</strong> button.

An attack, like the one described in the post, which does not require any exploit, can be easily made to look like a legitimate operation (forging the applet name and the certificate CN), and has <strong>50%</strong> chance to succeed is far from a good news for the IT industry. Based on personal experience, I know that this thing works more then 50%. It works all the time in fact.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/3d6a350133d92590f648098405210bae?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="NurBo"><span class="post-comment-author">NurBo</span><div class="post-comment-content">pdp you always amaze me keep up the good post man.

the world would be better if users were not given the choice of consuming things which the computer knows are wrong, at least not without going and explicitly tweaking some settings.  since everyone has now been trained to virtually ignore errors about invalid SSL Server certs, people blindly click 'OK' on almost any warning presented to them by the browser.

also, you may discount social engineering attacks as 'lame' or 'irrelevant'.  lots of people do.  this is precisely why they are so effective and popular among attackers.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/870419564f7ebe6cb4f631e98e14e5dd?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="G-Brain"><span class="post-comment-author">G-Brain</span><div class="post-comment-content">I don't like the title: "Hacking without 0days"?

It doesn't even make sense if you think about it. I mean, as opposed to "Hacking _with_ 0days"? Releasing an exploit for software X the same day software X is released _is_ the hack.

How do you hack _with_ a 0day? Run the pre-made Perl script? That isn't hacking.
