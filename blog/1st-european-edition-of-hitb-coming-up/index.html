The history of the HITB conferences can be traced back to 2002, the year in which the first ever edition of HITB took place in Malaysia.

<p>HITB aims to congregate members of the security community from all circles. From academics, and well known infosec personalities to loner-type independent researchers, and hobbyists just to name a few. I&#39;ve personally attended past editions in Kuala Lumpur and Dubai and loved that the attendees and speakers came from a wide variety of backgrounds. If you don&#39;t believe me, check out the <a href="http://photos.hackinthebox.org/gallery/">pix</a> of past conferences and you&#39;ll find sec nerds and corporate professionals all partying in unison. Indeed, the HITB conferences are not only educational, but among the most fun sec events I&#39;ve had the chance to attend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Registration is still open, so you are still on time to take advantage of a great speaker lineup and one of the <em>de facto</em> party capitals of Europe. The conference agenda can be found <a href="http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2010ams/agenda.pdf">here</a>.  I&#39;m really looking forward to Niels Teusink&#39;s <a href="http://blog.teusink.net/2010/05/presenting-at-hack-in-box-2010.html">presentation</a> on hacking Logitech wireless presenters and the release of detailed <a href="https://chatbotkit.com/examples">examples</a> of JIT-spray techniques against IE8, FF3.6 by <a href="http://dsecrg.com/">Alexey Sintsov</a> (originally <a href="http://www.semantiscope.com/research/BHDC2010/BHDC-2010-Slides-v2.pdf">discussed</a> by Dion Blazakis).</p>
<p>One more thing, almost forgot: there will be a bring-your-own-laptop <a href="http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2010ams/?page_id=41">web hacking challenge</a> at HITB EU.</p>
<p><em>See you at HITB Amsterdam next month!</em></p>
