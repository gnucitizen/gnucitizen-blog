<p>While collecting these WSDL services, I realized that python has no WSDL tools that suit my needs. Most of them are too big, too heavy and too dependent on other libraries. In the past, I have built a WSDL processing library for the sole purpose to help me out with investigating and consume Web Services. Unfortunately, due to the complexity involved in the Web Service specifications, my project came to a rough end. I simply couldn&#39;t keep up with everything that is coming out. These days I am trying to revitalize my WSDL processing project but it is too soon to tell how far I will go with it.
