<p>I would like to thank for the opportunity that has been given to me. It has been great honer to work with Seth Fogie, RSnake, Jeremiah Grossman, Anton Rager and Andrew Williams. We all had ups and downs while putting the book together, due to our busy schedules, but we&#39;ve made it and I am happy with the final result. It was a collective work at its best. I am looking forward to work on other projects with you guys.</p>
<p>I hope that this book will make more people aware of the current threats that concern Web application security. XSS attacks has been with us for a while, yet not that many people realize their potentials. We push really hard to raise the community and industry awareness through the work we publish in our blogs. However, we all have been working on small pieces of the whole puzzle. This book is the definitive guide for every web <strong>application</strong>/<strong>client side</strong> security enthusiast. It is a collection of some of the best publicly disclosed research around the area on browser and web security.</p>
<p>We could have, however, put a lot more into this book. We could have generate the <strong>ultimate</strong> client-side security bible. Nahhh, we tried to stay more down to earth and provide the reader with a technically rich book that is as complete as the predefined book length allowed it to be.</p>

It is good that this book is finished and is on way to the readers. Good reading for everyone. There will be more sources of professional and useful information about XSS soon.

Yes, man, I also like this quote :-). XSS is really the new Buffer Overflow. BO is a past and XSS is a future. Are you ready for a future?</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/613720a7bae4ce9b3c7a536782671ee9?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Aodhhan"><span class="post-comment-author">Aodhhan</span><div class="post-comment-content">I placed a pre-order for this book about 2 weeks ago.
