As far as the Cross-origin Scripting thing, I believe that this is the correct way to explain cross-site scripting and cross-zone scripting bugs, as we are not scripting SITES but different ORIGINS... therefore, Cross-origin scripting. It is much easier to use this one to describe things without too much repetition.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="beford"><span>beford</span><div class="post-comment-content">ODT link is broken.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span>pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">10x, it is fixed now</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2019 <a href=""></a>.
