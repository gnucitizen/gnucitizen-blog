As far as the Cross-origin Scripting thing, I believe that this is the correct way to explain cross-site scripting and cross-zone scripting bugs, as we are not scripting SITES but different ORIGINS... therefore, Cross-origin scripting. It is much easier to use this one to describe things without too much repetition.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/84e8ffa06cd17b4b405ff164c8354934?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="beford"><span class="post-comment-author">beford</span><div class="post-comment-content">ODT link is broken.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">10x, it is fixed now</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2020 <a href=""></a>.
