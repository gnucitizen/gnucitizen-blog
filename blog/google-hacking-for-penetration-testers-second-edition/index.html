<p>...from the book excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google is one of the 5 most popular sites on the internet with more than 380 million unique users per month (Nielsen/NetRatings 8/05). But, Googles search capabilities are so powerful, they sometimes discover content that no one ever intended to be publicly available on the Web including: social security numbers, credit card numbers, trade secrets, and federally classified documents. Google Hacking for Penetration Testers, Volume 2 shows the art of torqueing Google used by security professionals and system administrators to find this sensitive information and self-police their own organizations.</p>

Is this a second volume or a second edition?  My understanding is that a second volume is completely new material, where a second edition is simply the old material corrected and/or brought up to date.

If second volume, one would typically own both volumes 1 &amp; 2.  If second edition, one could simply purchase the second edition and be set.

Which is it?  I'll be buying the newer book regardless...</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">goober, this book is the second edition! it does have a lot of new sections though. thanks!</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2025 <a href=""></a>.
