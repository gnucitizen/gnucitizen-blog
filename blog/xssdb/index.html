<p>The GNUCITIZEN team members realize that it is a burden to fully maintain the XSS database ourselves. We believe that this task can be managed via our open platform with a little bit of help from the security community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, XSSDB allows you to browse through the original database. Soon you will be able to maintain the attack database yourself. If you have a proposal, question, suggestion or correction, please contact us.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 09/05/2011</strong>: This project is pretty much dead. Let us know if you want to revive it.</p>

We talked a bit back in May. As discussed, I re-posted the exports from dabbleDB here: http://xssdb.net/

Thanks
