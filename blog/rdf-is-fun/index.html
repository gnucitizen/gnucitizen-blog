<p>How this could be? Most of us know how databases look like: tables, columns, rows and primary keys. This is nice. The better you design your database the longer it will serve its purpose. In the RDF world, design doesn&#39;t matter. As long as the information is there it can be extracted and processed. This is a powerful concept that requires some serious thinking.</p>
<p>I highly recommend to have a look at RDF. It will help you with understanding database technologies better. RDF takes a bit of effort to learn but this skill can be applied to many situations quite effectively.</p>
