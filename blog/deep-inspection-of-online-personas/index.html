<p>Of course, I went ahead and looked up several people I know and various security researchers, etc. The stuff it returned were unbelievable: facebook accounts, myspace, flickr, twitter and whatnot.</p>

Hopefully those issues get somehow patched to avoid having the web flooded with false information about oneself. If possible at all - how to fix things broken by design?</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2020 <a href=""></a>. All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
