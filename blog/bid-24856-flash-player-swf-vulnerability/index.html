<p>The video above was assembled by the Symantec guys. It shows working examples for Firefox on Windows, Safari on MacOS and Opera on Wii. Demonstration exploit code is available from <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/data/vulnerabilities/exploits/24856.zip">SecurityFocus</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve met Stefano and Giorgio at OWASP in Italy and they are one heck of a good guys. Actually I sort of knew that something is going on behind the scenes, since Stefano was digging into the FLV format at that time. His presentation on XSS in Flash was really good. Please check it out from <a href="http://www.owasp.org/images/8/8c/OWASPAppSec2007Milan_TestingFlashApplications.ppt">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>So how bad is this vulnerability? I must say that it is pretty bad. Notice, that the exploit runs straight from YouTube.</em></p>

Stefano and Giorgio did responsible disclosure, thus the Flash Player plugin registered in my default Firefox profile (version 9.0r47) is not vulnerable.

Since, let me see... July 10th 2007... 13 days now?

Anyway Minded Security's advisory is very worth reading, many thanks for the pointer :)

you are right. Never the less I though it might be a good idea to mention the bug and also point out where the credits are due. :)</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/290e868e00e8429bf1624a461b8ef81e?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Giorgio Maone"><span class="post-comment-author">Giorgio Maone</span><div class="post-comment-content">OK, I had a chance to watch the Symantec video and finally realized how really scary this bug was.

The video starts with "Example 1: Windows with Firefox", but even before they open the compromised FLV, the attack has already transformed Firefox into Internet Explorer 6 for better exploitation, OMG!!!

even if there's a Flash player/plugin new version think about wii or smart phones with flash lite installed....
when vendors will fix it with an update?
 
@Pdp, thank for you kind words and for this blog entry!:)</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">Giorgio, Stefano is right. It will take some time to upgrade all flash instances. So, the bug is very serious. In fact, I am sure that someone will take it and make into a worm of some sort. BTW, 10x to Stefano and his team responsible disclosure the impact is a lot less significant.

Stefano, always. The research is worthed.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/290e868e00e8429bf1624a461b8ef81e?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Giorgio Maone"><span class="post-comment-author">Giorgio Maone</span><div class="post-comment-content">@Stefano: 
I agree on the impact of slow patch deployment on mobile devices, and I've been already contacted for some NoScript portings, actually.

Again thanks for the responsible disclosure and for your detailed and enjoyable advisory.

This is a pretty cool idea though seeing as how most services now use Flash players supporting the FLV file format, and generally use some shotty script to get the URL of the media from a variable in the address.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/9eb5ed1067bbc3c9675f8911316b7600?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="ascii"><span class="post-comment-author">ascii</span><div class="post-comment-content">@Giorgio Maone: let me see... thanks for your understanding, responsible disclosure MEANS that "it WAS big", if not it's not responsible disclosure.</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2020 <a href=""></a>.
