<ol>
<li><p>Achieve results by following a system. Do you want to get fit? Come up with a system that will make you fit. Do you want to write? Well, develop a system that creates time for you to write. It is easy to follow a system once it is in place.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trying to be successful is the wrong way to look at life. Try to make yourself useful instead. Ask yourself the following questions: How can I be useful? How can I contribute? Success comes from being useful to others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Speak less. Listen more. Ask questions to discover the base truths, first principles, and universal commonalities! Those that know how to listen effectively rule the world.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t obsess with your weaknesses. Concentrate on your strengths. You are not meant to be everything and I am sure there are a few things that you can do better than others. Being great in 2-3 things is better than being amazing in one specific thing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exercise humility. Everyone wants to be successful, respected and for their opinion to matter. Other people are just like you. Put yourself in their shoes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Think progress! Never settle for the status quo. Improve everything you do.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You will never gain anything from arguments - not with your spouse, family, friends, colleagues and never on the Internet. There are other ways to win people over and at the same time make long-lasting relationships despite the differences in opinion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you cannot measure, you cannot manage. This is especially true for your time. Record where your time goes to understand how to manage it effectively. Time is a scarce resource always in deficit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People are interested in other people. We are not concerned with the product of your work but by your method. In a true sense, we are most interested in how the sausage was made?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Copyright your faults. They are you.</p>
</li>
