<p>Backframe 2.x is truly awesome. You can download the 2.x branch from <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/svn">GNUCITIZEN&#39;s svn</a> but I must warn you that there is more. My own personal repository contains a few more things that are worth trying out but they will be left for future versions. Meanwhile, if you have any comments and suggestions about Backframe 2.x don&#39;t hesitate to leave them bellow.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 11/05/2011</strong>: this project is pretty much dead but feel free to contact us if you want to take the lead.</p>
