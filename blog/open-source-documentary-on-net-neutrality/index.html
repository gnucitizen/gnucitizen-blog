<p>This documentary was made some time ago last year but it is still applicable today. It brings some good points and exaggerates on others, but in general, I find it very interesting. The debate on <strong>Net Neutrality</strong> is something that has been going in the media and especially on the Web for some time now.</p>
<p><em>It is important to all of us!</em></p>

The net is not like TV or Radio, where the content is meticulously selected and quite well censored. The Web is free for all of us. Everyone has the potentials to become opinion former/maker. This is exactly what big media corporations don't like.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/2f6303f9095f59c14c3097ef4df566f5?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="kuza55"><span class="post-comment-author">kuza55</span><div class="post-comment-content">Interesting video. I saw quite a few articles/etc in net neutrality last year, and this is how I've come to see it:

Net Neutrality exists, and needs to exist because we do not trust large organisations to act in the public interest. And rightly so, since they have done nothing to gain our trust.

And that's not going to change, and so it needs to stay regulated. Or at least that's my view. Not that I have any say in it, since its a US law.

Oh, and why does inventing something automatically make a person's opinion important? Sure, they created something, people liked it and developed things around the idea, but I my view that doesn't make their opinion any more valid than anyone else's.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/711f58b095c5a8b45419d3e94df1129e?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">kuza55,

I agree, however, call it perception management. If you are the one who came up with the idea first, you will be considered as the most trusted information source about anything related to it.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/2f6303f9095f59c14c3097ef4df566f5?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="kuza55"><span class="post-comment-author">kuza55</span><div class="post-comment-content"><blockquote>I agree, however, call it perception management.

Ok, good, I'm not crazy then; it just irks me how we have all these inventors and other people voicing their opinion on "how things should be", etc.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/711f58b095c5a8b45419d3e94df1129e?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">well, it irks most of us, but this is how it should be. if you are one of these inventors/opinion formers/makers, you will have a completely different point of view on the matter, I guess.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/2f6303f9095f59c14c3097ef4df566f5?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="kuza55"><span class="post-comment-author">kuza55</span><div class="post-comment-content">Oh, I just found this: http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070627-ftc-shoots-down-net-neutrality-says-it-is-not-needed.html And thought you'd be interested.</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2022 <a href=""></a>.
