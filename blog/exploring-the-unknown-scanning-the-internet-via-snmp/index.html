<h2 id="why-snmp-">Why SNMP?</h2>
<p>2.5 million random IP addresses were surveyed via SNMP. &quot;Why SNMP you might be asking?&quot; Well, there are several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all SNMP is a UDP-based protocol which allows us to perform scanning at a much shorter time than via TCP-based protocols. Another advantage of UDP-based protocols is that the source IP address can be spoofed easily. In the case of SNMP, it means that an attacker could change configuration settings from a spoofed IP address provided that a valid write community string is identified or cracked. Needless to say changing config settings via SNMP can lead to a full compromise. Finally, we have been <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;q=site%3Agnucitizen.org+%28embedded+devices%29+OR+upnp&amp;btnG=Search">very involved</a> researching embedded devices lately, and since a significant amount of Internet devices are hackable via SNMP, such protocol was an obvious candidate.</p>
<h2 id="when-snmp-read-access-is-all-we-need-for-successful-pwnage">When SNMP read access is all we need for successful pwnage</h2>
<p>Gaining SNMP write access is of course usually considered to be a more serious issue than gaining SNMP read access only. However, even if a cracker only gained read access to a device/server via a SNMP community string, sometimes it would possible to extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords which would eventually lead to a compromise of the targeted systems. In order to accomplish this, all that is needed by the attacker is knowledge of an interesting OID to query. My point is that SNMP read access could be enough to fully own a device!</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-juicy-leaks-via-snmp-read-access">Examples of juicy leaks via SNMP read access</h2>
<p>For instance, Windows servers return the <a href="http://insecure.org/sploits/NT.smnp.domain_users.record_deletion.html">full list of usernames</a> by snmwalking the OID <code>1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25</code>. Or how about the BT Voyager 2000 router leaking the <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/366780">ISP credentials</a> including the password? Oh, wait, I almost forgot to mention HP JetDirect printers <a href="http://www.phenoelit-us.org/stuff/HP_snmp.txt">leaking</a> the <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/7001/exploit">admin password</a> via SNMP read access (using OIDs <code>.iso.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.3.9.4.2.1.3.9.1.1.0</code> and <code>.1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.3.9.1.1.13.0</code>). And of course the <a href="http://www.procheckup.com/Hacking_ZyXEL_Gateways.pdf">recently disclosed</a> Dynamic DNS credentials disclosure on ZyXEL Prestige routers via the OID <code>1.3.6.1.4.1.890.1.2.1.2.6.0</code> (see section 2.2 in the paper for more details). You get the point: lots of devices leak way too much information via SNMP read access.</p>
<h2 id="the-juicy-survey-stats-">The juicy survey stats!</h2>
<p>From a total number of 2.5 million random IP addresses, 5320 IP addresses responded to the submitted SNMP requests. Although this is only %0.2128 of all the IP addresses, we need to keep in mind that most Internet systems with SNMP support correspond to embedded devices, which only make a small portion of the Internet. One query was sent to each random IP using the community string <code>public</code>, which is often used as the default read community string. The OID queried on each request is <code>1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0</code> which is the system description (usually returns brand and model). The destination port used was 161/UDP. Although some systems used different default port numbers for SNMP daemons, 161 is definitely the most common one.</p>
<p>In order to protect the innocent, we hid the first two octets of the IP addresses included in our results CSV file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cat ./2dot5million-random-ips.csv | <span class="keyword">while</span> <span class="built_in">read</span> line
<span class="keyword">do</span>
    <span class="built_in">echo</span> -en <span class="string">'*.*.'</span>&gt;&gt;./2dot5million-random-ips.hidden.csv;
    <span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="variable">$line</span> | cut -d <span class="string">"."</span> -f 3- &gt;&gt; ./2dot5million-random-ips.hidden.csv
<span class="keyword">done</span></code></pre>
<p>The most common systems found were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.arrisi.com/products/touchstone/index.asp">ARRIS Touchstone Telephony Modems</a></li>
<li>Cisco routers</li>
<li>Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">AirPort</a> and Base Station</li>
<li>ZyXEL Prestige routers</li>
<li>Netopia routers</li>
<li>Windows 2000 servers</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, what kind of SNMP-enabled devices are the most popular on the Internet is very interesting information from a research point of view. For instance, if researching remote SNMP vulnerabilities, it would make sense to focus on a type of device that is widely-spread through the Internet.</p>

But the point of the experiment was very different. Our goal was to sample publicly available SNMP device as we find that people ignore SNMP, don't ask, don't know why. Given the fact that most embedded devices we have encountered so far, have some seriously screwed up SNMP implementations, we find this research very interesting. Therefore, we wanted to share it with the rest of the security community as it may come handy.

I have a 660H-61 Router. I have three questions to your pdf doc.

1.) All your discovered holes are only a security problem if the webinterface or snmp open on the wan, and if i had no attackers in the lan! Is that right?
2.) in the snmp (read/write) test my router is  not vulnerable (according to your document). What is the reason? snmp disabled or what?
4.) If in the Firewall rules no SNMP rule, is the port also open to the wan?
3.) How can i snmp disable? in telnet i haven't found a option!

Thanks very much!

1) However, since you own a ZyXEL router you should know that we found that many ISPs ship these routers with SNMP enabled on the *WAN*. Once you discover a ZyXEL router with SNMP reachable from the Internet you'll find out that many adjacent ZyXEL routers that belong to the same netblock suffer the same problem!
2) Please specify the section/page of the paper. Most likely it means that SNMP is *not* enabled with read and write access by default.
3) It *is* if SNMP is enabled and configured to be visible from the WAN interface (you can check this via the web and telnet interface)
4) We recommend you to disable SNMP which is explained in your router's manual (you should be able to do it via Telnet).</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/ef14ae4ef69235fa6c3709438357819d?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Adrian Pastor"><span class="post-comment-author">Adrian Pastor</span><div class="post-comment-content">@rezn: I guess that makes finding a vulnerability on these devices even more serious!

1. Ok, my Zyxel 660H-61 haven't any SNMP Firewall rule.
2. It's section 2.2. And my Router is not listen as vulnerable.
3. I havent't any snmp configuration page in the webinterface. In telnet i saw the same picture, you have in the pdf. But there i can't disable SNMP!
4. I haven't found any option to disable snmp!

<blockquote>Other ZyXEL models not mentioned in this paper might also be vulnerable to the same issues discussed. Additionally, not all ZyXEL models mentioned in this paper have been tested for the same vulnerabilities due to time constraints and lack of full unrestricted access (i.e.: full administrative access was not possible during a penetration test).</blockquote>

A person is guilty of an offence if:

you've used known default passwords to access other information without authorization, thus securing vital/security related information.

this is equivalent to using default admin passwords on an insecure website, and retrieving sensitive information or performing defacement.

You can even write a "home-made" one in bash by wrapping around the 'snmpget' (from the net-snmp package) command and requesting the 'system description' OID.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/e1b56e6ac7000449ef9d92d3d96d5d9f?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Persia"><span class="post-comment-author">Persia</span><div class="post-comment-content">These are for sure not something new quite alot of ppl can own almost any box running snmp.

to my expriance (90% success having read access) (20% with having any access)

base on their implimantation flaws causing overflows,avs,and very funny implimantaion of access control ,its not hard to elevate read access or even just to write to password oid  using READONLY access , for many, you can edit arp cache to your benefit with low access level , for some other utilize tftp to extract private password from config binary. not going to argue more .just seach the net see for yourself . or apply a general fuzzer.

btw: i was searching for private oid logo for assigned oids to use in some freeware . anybody care to share ?

Thanks</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/0367b81839d31a5fa3d7bea79ef71b9e?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pagvac"><span class="post-comment-author">pagvac</span><div class="post-comment-content">@Persia: it'd be great if you could name some specific examples of devices that allow you to edit the ARP cache with SNMP READ access only</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/f133f27eea8049b8718faa6a6a13a400?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="0xff0xff"><span class="post-comment-author">0xff0xff</span><div class="post-comment-content">i am currently writing a tool to manipulate snmp i am writing it in c# the reason for this is simple i cannot do certain things i need to in linux scripting for that matter and its just easier this way it will be impressive</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2024 <a href=""></a>.
