If you have been following the Full-disclosure mailing list, you have probably stumbled across several emails which claim that one of my GMail accounts have been compromised. That is right. It did happen but I am not that surprised since I&#39;ve been expecting it ever since I started doing security.</p>
<p>Why I am not pissed? Ever since I&#39;ve stepped in the position of a public figure with the GNUCITIZEN blog and the numerous speaking engagements and other things around those, I have never hidden any information regarding my work and personal life. I have always tried to be honest with you about the things I do and care about. <em>As a side note: I realize it it impossible to satisfy everyone in the community, so those of you, who have some personal issues regarding the blogs I write, can simply stop following my work.</em> The posted details are not a threat to me as they are very much outdated and irrelevant. I am quite surprised that from all the information out there, my private life is considered as the most valuable and interesting one. I would say that it is as useful as some tabloid junk. Funny enough only the name of my wife is correct :) sort off since she is now married to me.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank the attackers for putting me on the spotlight. As people say, every crisis is an opportunity and I will take it as such. Now is better time then ever to raise some serious questions to the information security community and our industry in general and perhaps change direction.</p>
<p>The problems in the Information Technology field are many and this particular case is a living proof for that. It is not a problem that my GMail inbox has been compromised. It is a problem that this can happen to anyone. Even doctors can catch viruses, right? I have never seen a network, application or website that did not surrender after persistent poking. I&#39;ve always said that hacking is not about skill set. It is mostly about dedication, patience and a lot of motivation. These elements speak a lot about the personal characteristics of the attacker. Tackling today&#39;s e-crime industry is a very, very hard challenge because it is not knowledge of technology that is the problem but our human nature which is easily corruptible by less controllable factors in our societies.</p>
<p>Here is the time to state that I am taking a full responsibility of what has happened and I am going to fully collaborate with the legal authorities regarding this matter. I was ensured that the problem can be easily resolved, since the attackers made many amateurs mistakes. I will let you know more as soon as I get an official confirmation.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I hope that everyone had as good time at Black Hat and Defcon as I had. Adrian has prepared a smoking post coming next and I will upload my updated slides soon.</p>
