We&#39;ve jump started <a href="http://www.blogsecurity.net">blogsecurity.net</a>, the only organization that deals with web blog security exclusively, and we also introduced great improvements into the GNUCITIZEN Gadgets Interface, which rocks as you can see from its project page <a href="/blog/gadgets">here</a>.

<p>Securls is a place where you can get the latest headlines from the security industry social networks. The website will allow you to glance through the most important bits and pieces without the hustle to manage and organize the vast streams of information yourself. At the moment the website is relatively small. However further improvements are planned to be launched very soon, so please stay tuned. So far, you can get the latest entries from a list of websites we believe cover large enough user base. Of course we are open for any suggestions that you may have in mind. In the upcoming months, we are going to integrate context sensitive system which will allow you to filter the information that is most relevant to you. Among the planned improvements we have things such as the Google Hacking Database and XSSED.com integration, video casts, tutorials, presentations, etc. We are also going to improve the current feeds and launch Securls version for mobiles.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that Securls is not the traditional link directory most sites provide anyway. Behind the scenes we work with the latest Mashup technology to integrate information sources, perform contextual searches, filter relevant information and in general provide the best quality of service available today. We are proud of what we&#39;ve got so far.</p>

Moreover, I hope that the user understands that we mashup feeds and other types of data in order to provide better quality of information. For example XSSED.com does not provide any means of extracting the information they collect, but we still have their feed which serves a good value of what's currently going on in terms of XSS exploits.
