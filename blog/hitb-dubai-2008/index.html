<p>It is needless to say that we&#39;ve made a lot of friends, talked to some of the best minds in the security world, and even had the chance to show some of our work. Adrian presented his talk on &quot;Cracking into Embedded Devices&quot; for the first time. You can download his slides from <a href="/files/2008/04/cracking-into-embedded-devices-hitb-dubai-2008.pdf">here</a>. I repeated my Client-side hacking talk from <a href="/blog/black-hat-europe-2008/">Black Hat Europe 2008</a> but with a few modifications. You can download the slides from <a href="/files/2008/04/Client-side-Security-Slides-HITB.pdf">here</a>. The actual paper can be downloaded from <a href="/blog/black-hat-europe-2008">here</a>.</p>
<p>Again, the event was great. The amount of effort the HITB crew put into the preparation was evident all the way till the end.</p>
