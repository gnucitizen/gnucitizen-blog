<p>Now there were a few funny things but the most funnies of all was that I&#39;ve got flagged by Seba for having a sales pitch within my slides. Actually, my intentions were totally different. Moreover, it is silly to sell very niche services to wide-range of Web app guys. I will never do that. Not to mention I don&#39;t have to do that.</p>
<p>So my apologies for the confusions, it was meant to be funny, not rude.</p>
