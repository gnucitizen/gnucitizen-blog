I dont think the information is collected 'evily' (is that even a word?). if the worst they can do with  my info is try and market new crap to the market, then i dont feel so threatened. i still shop and consume with my agency intact. unless the US military is going to beat down my door and attack my self and my family for not liking a particular film, or having daggy taste in music, or throwing a cyber sheep at someone i dont really care what they do with this data. capitalism is what it is: desperate and nasty. of-course these people will trawl through the internet like kids in india on a garbage pile looking for food. It's tragic, but I am not convinced from this bit of film that it is scary.</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2025 <a href=""></a>.
