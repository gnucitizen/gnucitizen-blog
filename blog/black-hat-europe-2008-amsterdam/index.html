<p>Supposedly, there are four full tracks for two days but I can see only two - or is that four track for two days - sounds more like it? I am speaking in track two on the first day, first slot, of the event, starting at 10:00 and finishing at 11:15, if everything goes as planned. Here is the abstract of my talk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Client-side software generally refers to a class of computer programs that are executed on the client, by the user&#39;s supporting environment, instead of the server. Both clients and servers are in constant interaction. In a Web environment, the client is represented by the user&#39;s web browser, while the server is the remote computer which serves dynamic content. In a much broader context, the client-server relationships can be represented by a network client connected to a WiFi network.
This paper[/presentation] describes numerous techniques for attacking Clients-side technologies. The content of the paper is based the research that has been conducted over the past year by the GNUCITIZEN Ethical Hacker Outfit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conference materials, slides and the paper will be released after the event for my convenience the convenience of the organizers.</p>
<p>There are a few very good <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-europe-08/bh-eu-08-speakers.html" title="Black Hat Speakers Page">talks</a> which I would like to attend but it will be primary a social event so if you are in the area and you would like to pop by for a <a href="https://chatbotkit.com">chat</a>, you are more then welcome to do so.</p>
