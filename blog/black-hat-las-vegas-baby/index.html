<p>I am still working on my slides, trying to add that edge-ness I am always striving to achieve combined with a severe doze of simplicity. Don&#39;t you know? Simple is the new black.</p>
<p>This time around I am visiting the conference as a tourist. So, I will concentrate more on socializing with all of you nerds, instead of concentrating that much on my talk and business matters. So, see you there.</p>
