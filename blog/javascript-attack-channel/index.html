<p>The tool is still experimental although it is quite stable at the time of writing. Within the next release the development cycle will be completed. I am planning to include this tool into <a href="/blog/attackapi">AttackAPI</a>. This is scheduled for release 0.8 which will contain several fixes and improvements.</p>
