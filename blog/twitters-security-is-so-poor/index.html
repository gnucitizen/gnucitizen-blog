<p>IMHO, the way the Twitter folks designed their system, is totally wrong. The one and only major concern is that 3rd-part software is allowed to communicate with Twitter&#39;s API by using the user&#39;s login credentials. This is a bit insane as you can imagine. Why would you want to share your username and password with someone you certainly don&#39;t trust? A better approach would have been if users can generate unique API keys which can be given to 3rd party applications. That way, users are not only in full control of their accounts but also, if the Twitter team decides to implement a more granular access control system at later stage, the transition will be smooth and easy.</p>

The initial point of entry wasn't a gap in Twitter's security. The hacker(s) gained access through a Google Apps account. The worry with a Google account is, it's web-based and therefore only as secure as the rest of the Internet. If yuor Google account is compromised and you use Google Docs in a serious commercial setting, your Twitter account will be the least of your worries.</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2022 <a href=""></a>.
