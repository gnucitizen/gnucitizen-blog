<p>Different sub-disciplines of AI and machine learning for sure including sub-branches of law, psychology, ethics and security.</p>
<p>Space travel - we are doing it today and we will continue doing it even more in the future.</p>
<p>Robotics - mostly design I imagine. You could be a robotics designer much like car designers these days.</p>
<p>Smart wearable clothing - a new world of possibilities will open when you convert atoms to bits which will require rethinking the whole industry from the ground up.</p>
<p>New types of entertainment - Netflix is already experimenting successfully with interactive content - as AR and VR get adopted will see more of it I am sure. This will require merging gaming with cinematography. It is already happening.</p>
<p>Bioengineering and nano-engineering!</p>
