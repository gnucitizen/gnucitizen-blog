Then I read the follow up link of the original <a href="http://portal.spidynamics.com/blogs/msutton/archive/2006/09/26/How-Prevalent-Are-SQL-Injection-Vulnerabilities_3F00_.aspx">post</a> from <a href="http://portal.spidynamics.com/blogs/msutton">Michael Sutton&#39;s blog</a>. In his post titled &quot;How Prevalent Are SQL Injection Vulnerabilities?&quot; Michael goes into details how to enumerate SQL Injection vulnerabilities with Google.</p>
<p>All that reminded me of my discussion about <a href="/blog/google-search-api-worms">Google AJAX Search API worms</a>. So, I decided to try and see how far an attacker can go with Michael&#39;s findings and my <a href="/blog/attackapi">AttackAPI</a>.</p>
<p>After 20 minutes in front of VIM I had a working code of a proof of concept tool that can enumerate quite a lot of SQL injection issues and with a little bit of guessing in a bruteforce manner exploit them. I am not 100% sure for the second part of this statement since I haven&#39;t really tried to exploit the vulnerable sites although in theory it should work.</p>
<p><em>To me it is obvious that new generation of worms will conquer the web sooner than I originally thought. I am blindly guessing!</em></p>
