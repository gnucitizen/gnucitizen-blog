<p>ZombieMap is highly extensible mapping application. Developers can extend virtually every aspect of the application environment. If you cannot see points on the map in the first 5 seconds, most probably there are no attached clients. For testing purposes, open another browser (different from the one you use for ZombieMap) and point it to the channel URL. Have fun!</p>
