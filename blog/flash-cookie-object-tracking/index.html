<p>The SWF source can be found bellow. Pay attention on how simple it actually is.</p>
<pre><code>[/files/2007/12/flashcookiemanager.as](/files/2007/12/flashcookiemanager.as)

In order to compile the file, you need the [Motion Tween ActionScript compiler](http://www.mtasc.org/). Just put the file within your **mtasc** directory and run the command like this:

mtasc.exe -cp std8 -swf FlashCookieManager.swf -header 0:0:0 FlashCookieManager.as</code></pre><p>&quot;Why is this of any good to anyone?&quot; Well, it does give you some power if you think about it. First of all, flash cookies are not cleared unless you manually delete them which happens never. So they are actually an excellent way for storing all sorts of goodies, like tracking codes, hiding malware for whatever reasons you might want to do that, etc.</p>
