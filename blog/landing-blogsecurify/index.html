The result of these efforts is our new initiative called Blogsecurify.</p>
<p>Blogsecurify was created to help individuals and organization to secure their social media infrastructure by running a set of security checks. The project is still in alpha stage although I am quite happy with the actual security testing framework, which I believe is the only one of its kind. The same framework will be used for several other projects but I will talk about them when their time come.</p>

I checked my blog :) It says .. perfect ... thus adding another check mark to security!

Will it create new entries via SQLi, etc. and does it only check blogs running WP for the moment? I didn't find some info about it.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span>pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">Alex, the test is none-exploitative so it should not create any bogus entries within your database.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="aungkhant"><span>aungkhant</span><div class="post-comment-content">At first glance , I think this checks against public exploits such as in OSVDB/Milw0rm. Great. As for me I just wanna write a perl script that greps "Generator" meta tag like Word 2.0.3 and greps latest version info. If out-dated, extract wordpress vulnerabilities in wordpress version &lt; latest and show them to user and warn her to upgrade.</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2019 <a href=""></a>.
