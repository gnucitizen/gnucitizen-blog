The result of these efforts is our new initiative called Blogsecurify.</p>
<p>Blogsecurify was created to help individuals and organization to secure their social media infrastructure by running a set of security checks. The project is still in alpha stage although I am quite happy with the actual security testing framework, which I believe is the only one of its kind. The same framework will be used for several other projects but I will talk about them when their time come.</p>

Great. As for me I just wanna write a perl script that greps "Generator" meta tag like Word 2.0.3 and greps latest version info. If out-dated, extract wordpress vulnerabilities in wordpress version &lt; latest and show them to user and warn her to upgrade.</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2020 <a href=""></a>.
