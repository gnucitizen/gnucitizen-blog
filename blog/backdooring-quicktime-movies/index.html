This post outlines an example of how to use QuickTime Movie files to trick the user into executing malicious JavaScript code. The technique presented here does not rely on a vulnerability bur rather on an insecure feature present in QuickTime player from version 3 up to the latest version 7.</p>
<p>This technique makes use of one of the very well know features in QuickTime called Text Tracks. Movie files are usually constructed of video and audio tracks. They provide the auditory and visual characteristics of the movie. On the top of them Text Tracks are responsible for subtitles, lyrics and other very interesting and highly productive accessibility features.</p>
<p>One layer bellow, Text Tracks can be of different types. There are many of them but the ones that are the most interesting are called <code>HREF Tracks</code>. <code>HREF</code> Tracks contain links that will be opened automatically or when the user clicks on the movie frame. These links can point to URLs from the <code>FTP/HTTP/HTTPS</code> space and also other supported protocols such as the JavaScript protocol (javascript:). Effectively, this feature can be used by attackers to hide malicious code inside a <code>.mov</code> file which will be executed automatically on preview.</p>
<p>HREF Tracks can be created with QuickTime Pro and probably other .mov editors and publishers. I wasn&#39;t able to find any command line tools although while researching, several good opensource QuickTime editing libraries were encountered. The following post examines the process of creating a backdoored .mov file with QuickTime Pro.</p>
<p>The first stage is to create a Text Track. Text Tracks are simple .txt files that contain special syntax. For the purpose of this proof of concept I composed the following track named (backdoor.txt).</p>
<pre><code>A&lt;javascript:alert(&quot;hello from backdoor&quot;)&gt; T&lt;&gt;</code></pre><p>Obviously the code above will display an alert box. The prefix A defines that the action will be automatic - no user interaction is required. There is also T flag, which specifies the target for the action. In this case it is kept null.</p>
<p>The next stage is to open both <code>backdoor.txt</code> and the movie that will be backdoored with QuickTime Pro. I chose <a href="/files/2006/09/sample.mov">Sample.mov</a>. This is standard movie file that is supplied with every default QuickTime installation.</p>
<p>Once opened, select the tack file and click on Edit -&gt; Select All. This will select the entire track. Than you need to copy it by going to Edit -&gt; Copy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/files/2006/09/backdoortxtmov.jpg" alt="Backdoor TXT MOV" title="Backdoor TXT MOV"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next stage is obviously pasting. Select Sample.mov and click on Edit -&gt; Select All and than Edit -&gt; Add to Selection and Scale. After performing this action you will see that part of Sample.mov frame is covered in black with text inside. This is the Text Track.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/files/2006/09/sampletxtmov.jpg" alt="Sample TXT MOV" title="Sample TXT MOV"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the Text Track is there, it has to be converted to HREF Track. Select Sample.mov window and click on Window -&gt; Show Movie Properties. In the Movie Properties dialog select &quot;Text Track&quot; and untick the check box next to the label. The last stage is to change the name of &quot;Text Track&quot; to &quot;HREFTrack&quot;. Figure this out yourself :).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/files/2006/09/hreftrack.jpg" alt="Hreftrack" title="Hreftrack"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When all this is done, Save as <a href="/files/2006/09/sample.mov">Sample.mov</a> to <a href="/files/2006/09/sample-backdoored.mov">Sample-backdoored.mov</a> or whatever you feel comfortable with.</p>
<p><em>The produced file will popup an alert box when opened in the browser window. There is no need to discuss again why this is dangerous and in what ways it can be used to bring havoc and destruction. The important bit is to never trust anything from the web. Movie trailers should not be previewed unless they come from apple.com. Don&#39;t open audio files or anything that ends with .mov. This is my advice for now :).</em></p>

I like the concept of XSS through the backdooring of media files. Everyone likes media files, so it's an ideal way to exploit both human and technical weaknesses.

Imagine downloading Michael's Jackson Thriller video clip which exploits your router's web interface in order to expose internal hosts to the Internet :D

Nice one!

However, it is possible to make a movie that is previewed inside a standalone QuickTime player to open a remote page which in tern can contain malicious code. Of course this is not very stealthy but can be successfully used to attack the browser at a very low level.

I haven’t tested opening URLs with VLC and Media Player Classic. However, if both players support HREFTracks, than they are affected by this issue.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/3e0298a2854e87166f6ddcee1fe4e005?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="nrg"><span class="post-comment-author">nrg</span><div class="post-comment-content">@Alberto You have to open in a program that can interpret javascript.

I'm not sure why.

This means that it will only be able to do something the web page itself can do, so that anybody able to put a movie into a web page could do the same by directly putting the necessary JavaScript code into it.

HREF tracks have been around for about 10 years, with all this functionality. This page is worth a look, especially the last section "More on QuickTime and HREFs.":

http://www.apple.com/quicktime/tutorials/hreftracks.html

Scarcely news, but it's great if you guys see some more of what QuickTime can do, even if you all have dastardly plans. ;)

The page linked above also shows how a MOV can open any QuickTime viewable file in another window *in QuickTime player itself*, if you wanted to make a little grey-goo / denial of service beastie.

There's also a turing-complete bytecode interpreter built-in to QuickTime. Apple usually forgets to mention it because it doesn't help to sell iPods.

http://developer.apple.com/documentation/quicktime/RM/rmWiredIntro.htm

So, if you're feeling particularly dastardly your MOV could even construct javascript URLs on the fly.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">Hi Brennan,

yes you are completely right. However, It is the same situation with everything in the computer security field. Look at BF attacks, for example. We know about them since the 80s. Still, people find clever ways to inject instructions into remote and local processes.

I am sure that HREF tracks is nothing new to core QuickTime/Apple developers. However, the problem is that they wasn't able to spot this potential misuse of their technology. It is not their fault. At the time when this technology was designed, I don't think that anyone was familiar with XSS to that extend as we are today. This problem is so common and I am sure we will see more of it very soon.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/2ced4279a627bd560f46883f7fd461ea?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Richard John"><span class="post-comment-author">Richard John</span><div class="post-comment-content">Hmm...

It will be good if someone can come up with Firefox extension, but this probably wont happen. The best thing to so is to wait for a fix from Adobe. Actually there is one that is offered to MySpace users only on Windows platform. If you happen to be on Window, go to MySpace an try to open .mov file that someone has hosted. Then you will receive the update. There are other solutions but they are all unofficial and they might work only in certain situations. Good luck.

I hope Apple understands that this is a serious security issue and it requires immediate actions.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/632819dac251da66e2131ada45ea5adc?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="psyc"><span class="post-comment-author">psyc</span><div class="post-comment-content">Hmm...

So, to the extent that people can be made to be extra reluctant to even open a .mov file, that helps keep the evidence (and danger to the actual perpetrators) as well-suppressed as it's been.

BTW, that site (like this one) uses JS, harmlessly, but its QT videos do not contain any embedded code or scripts of any kind.</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2022 <a href=""></a>. All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
