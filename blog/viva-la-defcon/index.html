<div class="screen">[![](/files/2008/08/defcon-300x225.jpg "defcon")](/files/2008/08/defcon.jpg)</div>

<p>This year somehow I managed to meet more people, attend more parties and see more presentations than during previous years. I had the pleasure to meet other fellow researchers for the first time such as <a href="http://natemcfeters.blogspot.com/">Nathan McFeters</a>, <a href="http://xs-sniper.com/">Billy (BK) Rios</a>, <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/">RSnake</a>, <a href="http://www.fthe.net/">id</a> and many others! All of them are security warriors whose research I was familiar with, but had never met in person. It&#39;s always nice to put a face to a name!</p>
<p>Although meeting the aforementioned individuals was of course a pleasure as I enjoyed having a nice chat with all of them, perhaps the most special and unexpected encounter was running into Captain Crunch!</p>
<p>In short, while chilling at the freak show party, I saw an elderly gentleman who appeared to be having a great time at the dance floor. This gentleman called my attention as he appeared to never run out of energy despite his active dancing activity. Eventually, I started noticing his resemblance with <a href="http://www.webcrunchers.com/crunch/origins.html">Captain Crunch</a>. So I told my wife: _you know, it&#39;s funny, but there is this man on the dance floor who looks a lot like a big icon from the early history of hacking: <em>captain crunch_</em>. My wife was familiar with such legend of the hacker culture thanks to having seen <a href="http://www.moviesfoundonline.com/secret_history_of_hacking.php">The Secret History of Hacking</a> and kind of agreed with me regarding his resemblance with Captain Crunch.</p>
<p>To me it was kind of surreal to find Captain Crunch raving at a Defcon party. Eventually I approached him and said: <em>excuse me, have you ever been told that you look like Captain Crunch?</em>. And he goes like: &quot;I am Captain Crunch!&quot; Amazing, I guess anything is possible at Defcon!</p>
<p>Also, I got to hangout with several friends including <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/author/pdp/">pdp</a> which is great. Regarding presentations, I saw quite a few, some more relevant to my profession as a pentester than others. My favorites were <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html#Alonso">Time-Based Blind SQL Injection using heavy queries</a>, <a href="http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html#Martin">Sniffing Cable Modems</a> and <a href="http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html#Nycmike">The World of Pager Sniffing</a>. All of them really fun talks!</p>
<p>Finally, I really enjoyed the showing of the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames">Wargames</a> movie for its 25th anniversary. Not only is Wargames one of my favorite (and perhaps more accurate) hacker movies, but <a href="http://blog.zerodaydefense.net/">David Scott Lewis</a> - a.k.a. Lightman - was there himself to answer questions made by DT and anyone in the audience. For those who don&#39;t know who David Scott Lewis is, he was the model for Matthew Broderick&#39;s character in the movie Wargames.</p>
