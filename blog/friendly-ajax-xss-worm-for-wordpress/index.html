<p>beNi, although the idea is interesting, you should not install or run any type of code on sites that you are not specifically authorized to. :) this is for real. You can get into a lot of problems for something like this no matter how noble your intentions are. Post the code and write a white paper how you did it. This is far more safer.</p>

The worm asks for permission and every step must be authorized by the Administrator, it just guides him through the process of applying the workarounds for the security vulnerabilities onto his Wordpress code. ;)</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span>pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">heh :) this is less critical but still. interesting research btw. have you informed the wordpress guys?</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="David Kierznowski"><span>David Kierznowski</span><div class="post-comment-content">pdp, heh, I have checked the mans work ... trying to rope him in for a chat :-)</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt=".mario"><span>.mario</span><div class="post-comment-content">Yep - very nice work indeed!

If you refer from your admin panel to my page, it pops up and asks you if you'd like to fix these vulns, then it goes to your admin panel back again, carrying its XSS payload and creating a Small setup, which tells the Admin where to add which parts of code to his Wordpress files in order to Fix the Vulnerabilities.
At the end, the Admin is prompet wheter he'd like to continue the worm by pasting a small "Referal-Checking" php line to his sidebar (manually by copy&amp;paste) or if he'd like to add a blogroll link to my blog (of course automatically) ;)

--cheers beni</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt=".mario"><span>.mario</span><div class="post-comment-content">Thanks for the explanation but as I already said - w/o code review no usage - don't get me wrong please. 

And at the moment I have no time to set up a testblog etc.

What's the problem with publishing the sources? You'd like to wait until the vulns are fixed?</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="mybeNi websecurity"><span>mybeNi websecurity</span><div class="post-comment-content">Hell, it is javascript, you'll find the scrip tags on your own</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="zqyves"><span>zqyves</span><div class="post-comment-content">hello all,

have a look at that:

there is actually a problem in the code of the XSS worm resulting in the "+" not encoded and interpreted as " " (space) by the browser.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt=".mario"><span>.mario</span><div class="post-comment-content">Yep - just caught that too via my feeds - so maybe now you know what I mean with no review no usage.</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2019 <a href=""></a>.
