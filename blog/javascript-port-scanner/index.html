Please adjust the timeout value to achieve better results. This tool has been tested on IE and Firefox. Firefox does not allow connections to very low ports such as 7, 21, etc. I haven&#39;t tested it on other browsers although it should work more or less the same way.</p>

Is it possible that some kind of protection is built in into Firefox to prevent JS portscanning? Whatever port I scan, I always get the answer open. Even with completly different hosts and timeout values.

TIA

It could be because of NoScript or any other plugin that you may have installed.
