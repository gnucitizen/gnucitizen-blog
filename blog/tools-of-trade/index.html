<p>Recently I had to communicate with a MSSQL server on a pentesting job. For that purpose I&#39;ve downloaded <code>sqsh</code>. Unfortunately the tool failed with a linking error. So I decided to go and download the sources and compile. I did that but the build failed because my environment was lacking certain unusual environment variables the tool needed to build successfully. Alright, running out of time, I decided to check whether there are other tools for SQL server. I found <code>dbishell</code> which is a tool written in perl. I run the tool for Sybase backend but it complained that I am missing libraries. So I downloaded the dbi sybase perl libraries and installed them. I run the tool again but it failed with an error. It couldn&#39;t display the error because I was lacking another perl library.</p>
<p>Ok, that was ridiculous and I desperately needed a solution. So I came up with something I do not normally do. I checked PHP&#39;s sybase integration online and I found that it is relatively straightforward to communicate with MSSQL backends from PHP scripts. I wrote a simple script to bruteforce the login with several passwords I had at hand. Once I found the login, lucky me, I wrote another script, again in PHP, just to dump various information from the database such as other database users and their hashes. Lucky me!</p>

<p>In summary, I spent ridiculous amount of time trying to make established frameworks and tools to work while I could have saved all the hustle and started with PHP from the beginning.</p>

<p>The reason I am telling you this story is because I have an important message convey here: &quot;Tools are just Tools!&quot; If metasploit cannot exploit the vulnerability perhaps you can create something yourself. If nessus fails to detect a problem, perhaps there is another approach you should use to handle the situation. We often start a new framework or tool and suddenly decide that it should handle all situations. Well that is virtually impossible! The situation always change.</p>
<p>So, don&#39;t stick to a single tool just because it works 80% of the time. And don&#39;t waste time trying to make the tool work in the rest 20%. It is pointless, especially when you are dealing with frameworks. There are a lot more solutions out there you can employ to solve your particular problem. These solutions may not be elegant and perhaps they are written in something as unconventional as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">brainfuck</a>, but they are solutions nevertheless.</p>
<p><em>Remember, tools solve problems! If a tool cannot solve the problem it is no longer a tool. It is a useless blob!</em></p>

I can't remember the times I've struggled with a seemingly simple (but boring and tedious) computing operation that I would have done in, say, 10 minutes manually, but instead spending several times more fooling around with more sophisticated tools. One easy thing that works for me in this cases -- when you're going to experiment with an allegedly "time-saving" tool, specify a time limit for playing with it to get the right result. I'd probably set it at something like 30-70% of the available time, just to have a margin for still doing it the 'stupid' way.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="holiman"><span class="post-comment-author">holiman</span><div class="post-comment-content">You are *so* right. And not just for pen-testing, but all aspects of software development. Developers (or, more commonly, managers) stare themselves blind at tools and acronyms, which is why CV:s usually are mostly long lists of tools. 

I try to live by the motto: "There is no magic". If I find that a particular tool contains "magic", I need to dispel that magic by finding out how it works - and by understanding it I will be able to do it myself if that particular tool should not work.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">I think that we need to concentrate more on the practical side of things...</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="nobody"><span class="post-comment-author">nobody</span><div class="post-comment-content">I would like to confront the "holiman" by expressing an opinion opposite to the common understanding that there is "no magic". There is magic and it is very real. Magic is when you find something first! By the time you understand things a.k.a. "magic" more "magic" is being created, by magicians of course not by you. :) Same applies to so called tools. I am really enjoying myself when I read about so called "security" exploits. The real security exploits are never made public. System compromises that are worth mentioning are never made public also. What is published on the Internet is a waste of time. And ouch :) Google is not your friend.</div></div></div></div></article><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; 2020 <a href=""></a>. All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
