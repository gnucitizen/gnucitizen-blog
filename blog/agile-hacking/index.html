<p>Help us create the best hacking reference/manual/book ever made. We provide the scene, the resources and the money, and you keep the credits and the control over the eventual profits. Read on.</p>

<p>During the next couple of months we are open for your submissions. The idea is to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">harvest the knowledge of the crowds</a> in order to create the best hacker manual ever made. The process is very simple. We, as well as you, will commit new hacks, tips, tricks and techniques in the field of information security to our system. Each hack will be published under its author&#39;s Name and URL (blog, site, etc) on the blog under the title and category of &quot;Agile Hacking&quot;. Once we have a good enough number of hacks, we will tip some money in, in order to make our mutual work into a book, which will preserve all the credits of its authors. The book will be available for a free download but also as a hard/soft cover printed version. If the book makes some money, you will decide how to spend them. It just cannot get better then that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Agile Hacking&quot; like in quick and well-coordinated in movement or marked by an ability to think quickly, mentally acute or aware. Overall, a breathtaking experience. Keep it small, keep it simple, keep it agile!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For now, the entire thing will take the form of a mailing list which was build for the sole purpose. We would like to keep the process as simple and transparent as possible. However, if the crowd decides that this mechanism is inefficient, we will move to a more robust system. Keep in mind that the point is to harvest the knowledge of the crowd. If you want to be involved with managing the process, let us know. After all, it is a free/open project and everybody is equal.</p>

I agree with you, wiki seems to be the right type of platform for this type of project. Although, there are many wikies that were created for similar purposes and none of them are as active as we would like them to be. The reason for this is because content grows old with time.

This is why, after careful consideration, we decided that by keeping the content chunked into small pieces, loosely joined, each one of which self-contained in a blog post, we will provide an agile platform which everybody will benefit from and no one will be pressured by the burden to main unmaintainable content and assure quality.

Moreover, as you said. Most of the things on the Web are old so we should not start something that may eventually fade away with time. You, as well as me, would rather ensure the dynamics of this project.

Let's keep it simple for now and see how it goes. If at some point the crowd decides that a Wiki is a better platform, we will start using that.

Annotate why it is of interest to you, your thought process, little things you learned along the way, bumps/obsticles, revalations etc.

The best examples are milw0rm and openSec... If you talk about a forum where people can exchange and discuss ideas (sec related), those stuff exists too (e.g. governmentsec). For new exploits or 0days follow the mailinglists like bugtrack. And there are even good mailinglists for pentesters around.

So what I basically want to say is that you have just to use already existent sources. If you really stick to the idea of that wiki, think about the maintenance problem. Even the real wiki got some of that issues.

Just my 2 cents
