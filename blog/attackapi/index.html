<p>AttackAPI is standard part of many public and private security related projects supported by GNUCITIZEN and other organizations. The library had many incarnations and not all of them were made public. Simply put, internally we call everything AttackAPI that relats to common set of routines useful for offensive research.</p>
<p>AttackAPI is open source (GPLv2) project and as such you should feel free to extend upon it. Because AttackAPI means everything and nothing at the same time, for us this project is mostly a placeholder for future work. However, you can still check SVN tags for previous work and code.</p>

At the moment I am pretty much stuck here with a problem regarding execution of an AttackApi script in an IE 6 environment. Is there anything like a chat or forum which can be used for problems like this (I'd rather do it this way than posting it to code.google.com, as I am not sure if this really is an issue or simply stupidity of me). I'd really like to see a AttackAPI community out there..:)</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/711f58b095c5a8b45419d3e94df1129e?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">rootkid, I've created <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/attackapi" rel="nofollow">AttackAPI Google group</a>. Feel free to post your stuff there. I would like to build community around the library too since V3 looks very promising in terms of new features. I am not sure whether I discussed this thing somewhere else, but AttackAPIv3 has features to export the most basic set of requirements for each attack payload.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/11a1164bee690aa4030e61f4124cf1bf?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="zaib"><span class="post-comment-author">zaib</span><div class="post-comment-content">Where to download attackAPI package because this link http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/attackapi/AttackAPI.zip
