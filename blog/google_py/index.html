<p>Use the script responsibly and keep in mind Google&#39;s Terms of Service before doing anything drastic. The command line interface is configured to run through up to 5 pages. You can change that at source level or if you embed it into your own scripts.</p>

I didn't know how to change the user agent from python when I wrote mine though, so I did it through another site that returns results from Google, they don't check.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">Willy, the Google.py code shows how to change the user agent.

Now about this post, back in the hot google hacking days I wrote a similar script but in Perl. Some months ago I wrote it in PHP and publish a online version of this "google parser" named GooParser to test a couple of things. You can try it here: <a href="http://goohackle.com/scripts/google_parser.php" rel="nofollow">Google Parser</a>

Cheers,

I also wrote a googlescraper in ruby. During my tests I had the impression that google not only checks the agent. Therefore I also added random delay in getting next pages and resetting cookies on top of randomizing agents. Oh...and also the use of a proxy (so privoxy with tor can be used)...</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">yep, good enough solution to evade Google's bot detection mechanism.

I'm working on something similar, together with someone else. Basically it combines dns enumeration with some google scraping and whois stuff. It's a major rewrite of the old dnsenum thingy.
