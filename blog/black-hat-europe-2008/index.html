In this post, you will be able to find information regarding my talk and research. My presentation was titled <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-europe-08/bh-eu-08-speakers.html#Petkov">Client-side Security</a>. Here is the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Client-side software generally refers to a class of computer programs that are executed on the client, by the user&#39;s supporting environment, instead of the server. Both clients and servers are in constant interaction. In a Web environment, the client is represented by the user&#39;s web browser, while the server is the remote computer which serves dynamic content. In a much broader context, the client-server relationships can be represented by a network client connected to a WiFi network.</p>
<p>This paper[/presentation] describes numerous techniques for attacking Clients-side technologies. The content of the paper is based the research that has been conducted over the past year by the GNUCITIZEN Ethical Hacker Outfit.</p>
