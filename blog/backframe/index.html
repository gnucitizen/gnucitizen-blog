<p>Backframe is very extensible attack console, resembling all features from a class of tools known as XSS proxies. The actual framework contains a lot of more features. Developers can extend virtually every aspect of the Backframe environment. You can write inline scripts/profiles which are loaded when the application starts and as such guarantee maximum extensibility.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 09/05/2011</strong>: We&#39;ve stopped supporting the online version. However, you can still download the sources from  the public SVN repository over <a href="http://code.google.com/p/backframe/">here</a>.</p>
