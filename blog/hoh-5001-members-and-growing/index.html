<p>I would like to thank all members for creating one of the most colorful, extraordinary, exciting, provocative, intelligent, intense, creative... community out there. I&#39;ve said that this is a community effort and sure it is.</p>
<p>We have long way ahead of us. It is a journey not a destination and we have some great ideas too materialize. Thanks to all of you, one more time.</p>
