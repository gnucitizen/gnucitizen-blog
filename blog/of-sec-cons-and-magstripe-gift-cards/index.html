<p>I&#39;ve been researching, pentesting, and preparing two different presentations which I gave at <a href="http://2009.confidence.org.pl/prelegenci/adrian-pastor">CONFidence</a> in Krakow, and <a href="http://eusecwest.com/agenda.html">EUSecWest</a> in London. pdp has also been busy presenting at <a href="http://conference.auscert.org.au/conf2009/presenter.php?presenter_id=P_P">AusCERT2009</a>. In his Weaponry 2.0, pdp talked about current challenges experienced by pentesters, shared some of his experiments (i.e.: using QEMU) and introduced his <a href="/blog/jeriko-group-and-source-code-repository/">Jeriko</a> pentesting environment (NOT framework!).</p>
<p>My CONFidence presentation was on PCI DSS, and credit card theft from a pentester&#39;s perspective. I attempted to explain why it&#39;s possible for unsophisticated criminals to compromise credit card data. I also shared my frustrations with the PCI DSS standards, including some of its current weaknesses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my EUSecWest presentation was on attacking magstripes gift cards, which apppear to be on the rise in the UK. The core of the research is about <em>cloning (activated) gift cards without physically swiping the magnetic stripes.</em> Trust me when I say that there is a lot of truth on <a href="http://twitter.com/dragosr/status/1949951235">Drago&#39;s</a> tweet regarding this research! My EUSecWest slides have just been recently <a href="http://research.corsaire.com/presentations/">published</a>. More details will soon be available on a white paper which will be available on <a href="http://research.corsaire.com/">Corsaire Research</a> website.</p>
<h2 id="thanks-shouts">Thanks &amp; Shouts</h2>
<p>I&#39;d like to thank the organizers of these two great conferences, namely Andrzej Targosz from CONFidence and <a href="http://twitter.com/dragosr">Dragos Ruiu</a> from EUSecWest (plus their respective crews of course).</p>
<p>Also, special thanks to <a href="http://www.corsaire.com/">Corsaire</a> who sponsored the time needed to prepare my presentation. I originally started my magstripe gift cards research about 3 years ago, but left it unattended for so long. If it wasn&#39;t for Corsaire, this research wouldn&#39;t have been resumed.</p>
<p><em>Finally, thanks to everyone who helped me prepare my presentations such as Jan Fry, Amir Azam, pavlovs_dog, Monsy Carlo, etc.</em></p>
