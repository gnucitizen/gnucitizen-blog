<p>GHDB (a.k.a. Google Hacking Database) is HTML/JavaScript wrapper application that uses advance JavaScript techniques to scrape information from <a href="http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/ghdb.php">Johnny&#39;s Google Hacking Database</a> without the need for hosted server side scripts.</p>
<p>Why this application is interesting you may ask? We are not hosing any server side scripts on our side, and Johnny&#39;s <a href="http://johnny.ihackstuff.com">johnny.ihackstuff.com</a> does not provide any JSON export of the database either, how the heck we still manage to fetch the data? Well, we are using a PIPE which is entirely online based. Online services are very Web2.0 so expect to see more of them very soon. For Web based malware perspective, this means that they no longer need server side support.</p>
<p>You can use this tool as a browser based replacement of the cDc&#39;s (cult of the dead cow) <a href="http://www.goolag.org/">Goolag</a> tool.</p>
<p><em>The project is now part of GNUCITIZEN&#39;s <a href="http://www.secapps.com">Secapps</a> application stack.</em></p>

Not that that will necessarily fix anything - offsite script linking isn't going to disappear - I guess we should all just agree - you are right and the way the web is heading this will only get worse.</div></div><div class="post-comment"><img class="post-comment-avatar" src="//gravatar.com/avatar/#{comment.avatar}?s=256&amp;d=retro" alt="Dain"><span class="post-comment-author">Dain</span><div class="post-comment-content">Most impressive, as is all of the work you're doing.

Having to expose your network to anothers in order to obtain the service. Not knowing their standards for security, and how well they maintain them. Right now, we restrict WS to very few enclaves. Even then, every packet route is restricted restricted in its routing from subnet to subnet. 

Which is good current, yet it undermines the true vision of webservices. IN which you can find anything you need, anytime you want. Getting and sending information to profit both ends. A big headache.

Thanks for keeping it visible!

We are planning to open our GHDB app to the public soon. I will try to speedup the project since the official GHDB database seams to be down right now.
