<p>The application is in its 0.1a release currently. This means that a lot more work needs to be done. Right now it is quite stable and it should work well with attack channels similar to the one described <a href="/blog/persistent-bi-directional-communication-channels">here</a>. Check the <a href="/blog/attackapi">AttackAPI</a> project for the attack channel complete source code.</p>
<p>So what is Backweb anyway? The Backweb project is an experiment that was designed to create a full featured attack console for exploiting web browsers, web users and remote applications. Those who are familiar with <a href="http://xss-proxy.sourceforge.net/">XSS Proxy</a> or even <a href="http://www.bindshell.net/tools/beef">BEEF</a> might already be familiar with the core principles of the Backweb project.</p>
<p>I tried to make the core as modular as possible although I didn&#39;t try vary hard. Those who are curios enough to check the source code will see a few bugs. As a said earlier this is the 0.1a (alpha) release. There is a new release in the SVN trunk that will be ready for download quite soon.</p>
<p><em>Documentation is also expected in the next month. If any one is willing to contribute please feel free to <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/contacts">contact me</a>. For ideas of how to use this application read this blog.</em></p>
