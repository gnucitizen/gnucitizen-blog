In the processes we realized that we have to find a new home for several of our projects. It was a tough decision because we had a lot of projects on our hands and there were even more pending to be completed in some fashion. Nevertheless, we decided to go with the plan. So, the idea of <a href="http://www.secapps.com">Secapps</a> was born.</p>
<p>So what is <a href="http://www.secapps.com">Secapps</a>? Secapps is the new home of our <a href="/blog/the-extreme-web-based-google-hacking-tool/">GHDB</a> tool. It will also be the new home for several other tools and perhaps an user-supported index of external tools regardless whether they are online or offline. Secapps can also be a free hosting environment for your application. Seriously, if you have an application that we like, we can host it there for you. It will be part of Secapp&#39;s application stack and as such sponsored by us.</p>
<p>I can see a few positive ways Secapps can develop in the future. For now, it will simply host our online security tools. If you have any suggestions or recommendations, do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
