<p>The research is made of two components: a purple paper (one of the traditions we follow in GNUCITIZEN) and a video. I promise you that I won&#39;t bore you with PoCs, but actual Hollywood-style exploits. This includes the classic attack in which the legitimate video stream gets replaced by another stream that keeps looping forever (remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_(film))">Speed</a>. We even created a <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEaasduNWBE">demo video</a> of this attack! Blame <a href="http://www.alcrypto.co.uk/">Major Malfunction</a> (soon to be featured) for this, as he suggested the third-party-video infinite loop technique.</p>
<p>Here are some of the juicy bits, mentioned in the paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-browser XSS phishing</li>
<li>Replacing the legitimate video stream with our own</li>
<li>Adding a Backdoor Root Account</li>
<li>Stealing the &#39;passwd&#39; File</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an <a href="https://chatbotkit.com/examples">example</a> of an exploit that we&#39;ve come up with. You don&#39;t know what it is doing? Well, read the paper for more details:</p>

I made a new video where the victim admin is NOT required to visit a third-party site but rather check the camera's logs page:
