It seams that Facebook's Homepage Source code was leaked. This is yet to be confirmed by Facebook themselves so do not take it for real.

I've spent a couple of minutes reading the single PHP file and there is nothing wrong with it that is obvious to me at this stage, apart from the fact it gives us a pretty good idea how the software is structured and where to find interesting libraries and other components of the Facebook application. If you find anything interesting please send it to us privately or I would suggest to contact the Facebook straightaway.

```php
	[source code taken down, let's be nice]!
```
