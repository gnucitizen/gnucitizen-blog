beNi has [discovered](http://mybeni.rootzilla.de/mybeNi/2007/wordpress_zeroday_vulnerability_roundhouse_kick_and_why_i_nearly_wrote_the_first_blog_worm/) several interesting vulnerabilities for Wordpress and has [coded](http://mybeni.rootzilla.de/mybeNi/2007/this_is_the_first_weblog_xss_worm/) a friendly AJAX XSS worm that works behind your back and fixes them. I am sure that [David (dk)](http://www.gnucitizen.org/about/dk) will go in more details on the [matter](http://blogsecurity.net) as soon as he stops playing with [Technika](/blog/technika) and the TSF framework.

beNi, although the idea is interesting, you should not install or run any type of code on sites that you are not specifically authorized to. :) this is for real. You can get into a lot of problems for something like this no matter how noble your intentions are. Post the code and write a white paper how you did it. This is far more safer.
