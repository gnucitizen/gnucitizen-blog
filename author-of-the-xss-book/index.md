It is probably about time to announce that I am one of the authors of the upcoming XSS Book, [RSnake talked about](http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20070128/xss-book/) a month ago on his [blog](http://ha.ckers.org). The complete list of authors is: Seth Fogie, Jeremiah Grossman, Robert Hansen, Anton Rager and Petko Petkov (a.k.a me).

The book is going quite well and I hope that it will provide a good starting point for those who are interested in getting into client-side web security but don't know much about it. The book is also designed to cover some advance topics for those who want to expand their current knowledge. I guess everybody will be happy. You can preorder it from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Cross-Site-Scripting-Attacks-Exploits/dp/1597491543/sr=1-1/qid=1170769149/ref=sr_1_1/104-1412087-4929535?ie=UTF8&s=books). This is the only book on Cross-site Scripting attacks and related topics, for now, so I hope it will be a success.
