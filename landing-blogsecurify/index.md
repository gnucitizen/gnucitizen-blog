During the last couple of days, we combined forces with [Blogsecurity.NET](http://www.blogsecurity.net) in an effort to improve their [online Wordpress vulnerability scanner](http://blogsecurity.net/cgi-bin/wp-scanner.cgi). The result of these efforts is our new initiative called Blogsecurify.

Blogsecurify was created to help individuals and organization to secure their social media infrastructure by running a set of security checks. The project is still in alpha stage although I am quite happy with the actual security testing framework, which I believe is the only one of its kind. The same framework will be used for several other projects but I will talk about them when their time come.
