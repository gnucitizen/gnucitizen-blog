> I am closing the season with the following **HIGH** Risk vulnerability: Adobe Acrobat/Reader PDF documents can be used to compromise your Windows box. Completely!!! Invisibly and unwillingly!!! All it takes is to open a PDF document or stumble across a page which embeds one.

The issue is quite **critical** given the fact that PDF documents are in the core of today's modern business. This and the fact that it may take a while for Adobe to fix their closed source product, are the reasons why I am not going to publish any POCs. You have to take my word for it. The POCs will be released when an update is available.

> Adobe's representatives can contact me from the usual [place](http://www.gnucitizen.org/contact). My advise for you is not to open any PDF files (locally or remotely). Other PDF viewers might be vulnerable too. The issues was verified on Windows XP SP2 with the latest Adobe Reader 8.1, although previous versions are also affected.

_A formal summary and conclusion of the recent **GNUCITIZEN**'s bug hunt to be expected soon._
