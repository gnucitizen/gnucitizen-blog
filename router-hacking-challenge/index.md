We want you to hack your router! Yes, You. We want you to hack your router and make your findings public on this very same page, the [sla.ckers](http://sla.ckers.org/forum/read.php?13,20128) forum or at _hackerwebzine[at]gmail[dot]com_. The best and most interesting hacks will receive credit, a lot of attention and good media coverage.

The challenge is supposed to run from 2nd February until 29th February, though it is something that is yet to be clarified because we know that there is a lot to be found.

The reason why we do this is because we want you to help the community to map the current state of embedded devices vulnerabilities. GNUCITIZEN members [have](/blog/hacking-the-interwebs) [been](/blog/call-jacking) [actively](/blog/bt-home-flub-pwnin-the-bt-home-hub) [involved](/blog/security-and-hacking-scene-in-london/) with finding vulnerabilities in routers in the past. We believe that embedded devices hacking is a huge topic that is yet to be explored in depth. Your submissions will be included in numerous presentations and research materials and will be credited appropriately.

> The rules are very flexible, every kind of exploit is allowed: from buffer overflows to CSRF issues that plague many routers.
