I thought that this will be interesting to some of you. [This](http://www.gnucitizen.org/static/blog/2008/11/gnucitizen.jpeg) is how GNUCITIZEN looked like back in 2005 when it was just a personal website rather than a group of like-minded people as it is today.

It is quite nice to look back and see how things progressed over the years.
