> Web2.0 is not AJAX. Although it is true that client-side (AJAX) security has a significant part of the Web2.0 ecosystem, it is important to realize its role. There are far too many other aspects that we need to look into.

I am going to speak at [OWASP's mini-conference in Brussels](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Belgium#Next_Event:_OWASP_Day_.286-Sep-2007.29) on 6th of September about the dangers of Web2.0. I am going to reveal some of the research that I have been conducting in the past couple of months on what exactly is Web2.0 hacking. During the conference I am also going to drop a paper and a conceptual tool called **Renaissance**. So stay tuned. If you have a chance, come visit the GC group in Brussels. It will be fun.

Here is the outline of my talk:

* What is Web2.0?
* What is Web2.0 hacking?
* The Importance of Information
* Distribution Channels
* Traffic Shaping and Influence
* The Web2.0 highways
* Use and Abuse - Web2.0 Services
* Cyber dogma - hacking big brother
* Antisocial
* Masters, slaves, bots and intelligent agents
* The Importance of Client-side Security in the Web2.0 world
* Attacking the Server - the interwebs are going down
* The security of the global Web
* One drop on a spider Web
* Conclusion

_I will see you in Brussels._
