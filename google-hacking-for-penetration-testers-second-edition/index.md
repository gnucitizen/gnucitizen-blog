...from the book excerpt:

> Google is one of the 5 most popular sites on the internet with more than 380 million unique users per month (Nielsen/NetRatings 8/05). But, Googles search capabilities are so powerful, they sometimes discover content that no one ever intended to be publicly available on the Web including: social security numbers, credit card numbers, trade secrets, and federally classified documents. Google Hacking for Penetration Testers, Volume 2 shows the art of torqueing Google used by security professionals and system administrators to find this sensitive information and self-police their own organizations.
